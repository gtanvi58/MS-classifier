O Muslims everywhere, glad tidings to you and expect good",1
"Raise your head high, for today  by Allahs grace  you have a state and Khilafah, which will return your dignity, might, rights, and leadership
It is a state where the Arab and non-Arab, the white man and black man, the easterner and westerner are all brothers
It is a Khilafah that gathered the Caucasian, Indian, Chinese, Shami, Iraqi, Yemeni, Egyptian, Maghribi (North African), American, French, German, and Australian",1
"Allah brought their hearts together, and thus, they became brothers by His grace, loving each other for the sake of Allah, standing in a single trench, defending and guarding each other, and sacrificing themselves for one another
Their blood mixed and became one, under a single flag and goal, in one pavilion, enjoying this blessing, the blessing of faithful brotherhood
If kings were to taste this blessing, they would abandon their kingdoms and fight over this grace",1
"So all praise and thanks are due to Allah
Soon, by Allahs permission, a day will come when the Muslim will walk everywhere as a master, having honor, being revered, with his head raised high and his dignity preserved
Anyone who dares to offend him will be disciplined, and any hand that reaches out to harm him will be cut off",1

Whoever was heedless must now be alert
Whoever was sleeping must now awaken",1
"Whoever was shocked and amazed must comprehend
The Muslims today have a loud, thundering statement, and possess heavy boots
They have a statement to make that will cause the world to hear and understand the meaning of terrorism, and boots that will trample the idol of nationalism, destroy the idol of democracy, and uncover its deviant nature",1
"The time has come for those generations that were drowning in oceans of disgrace, being nursed on the milk of humiliation, and being ruled by the vilest of all people, after their long slumber in the darkness of neglect  the time has come for them to rise
The time has come for the Ummah of Muhammad (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) to wake up from its sleep, remove the garments of dishonor, and shake off the dust of humiliation and disgrace, for the era of lamenting and moaning has gone, and the dawn of honor has emerged anew
The sun of jihad has risen",1
"The glad tidings of good are shining
Triumph looms on the horizon
The signs of victory have appeared",1
"O Ummah of Islam, indeed the world today has been divided into two camps and two trenches, with no third camp present: The camp of Islam and faith, and the camp of kufr (disbelief) and hypocrisy  the camp of the Muslims and the mujahidin everywhere, and the camp of the jews, the crusaders, their allies, and with them the rest of the nations and religions of kufr, all being led by America and Russia, and being mobilized by the jews
Therefore, rush O Muslims to your state
Yes, it is your state",1
"Rush, because Syria is not for the Syrians, and Iraq is not for the Iraqis

The State is a state for all Muslims",1
"The land is for the Muslims, all the Muslims
O Muslims everywhere, whoever is capable of performing hijrah (emigration) to the Islamic State, then let him do so, because hijrah to the land of Islam is obligatory
We make a special call to the scholars, fuqaha (experts in Islamic jurisprudence), and callers, especially the judges, as well as people with military, administrative, and service expertise, and medical doctors and engineers of all different specializations and fields",1
"We call them and remind them to fear Allah, for their emigration is wajib ayni (an individual obligation), so that they can answer the dire need of the Muslims for them
People are ignorant of their religion and they thirst for those who can teach them and help them understand it
So fear Allah, O slaves of Allah",1
"""The spark has been lit here in Iraq, and its heat will continue to intensify - by Allah's permission - until in burns
O Allah, whoever is the liar, then make Your curse come upon him, show us a sign regarding him, and make an example out of him

"O Allah, subject them to the authority of diseases and disasters
O Allah, if this is a state of khaw?rij, then break its back, kills its leaders, make its flag fall, and guide its soldiers to the truth
O Allah, and if it is a state of Islam that rules by Your book and the tradition of Your prophet, and performs jih?d against your enemies, then keep it firm, strengthen it, support it, grant it authority in the land, and make it a khil?fah upon the prophetic methodology",1
"He then said, O Allah, deal with everyone who has split the rank of the muj?hid?n, divided their word, delighted the kuff?r, angered the believers, and set the jih?d back many years
Ash-Sh?m? said, I perform mub?halah and say that you examine the people on their creed
The proof for this is your setting of conditions to accept Shaykh al-Muhaysin?s initiative",1
"This in general is a form of examining peoples creeds, not any people, rather that of the best people
I mean the muj?hid?n including the different muj?hid groups like the Islamic Front, Jayshul-Muj?hid?n, and others [The Mub?halah]
Ash-Sh?m? also said, Describing the fighting taking place as a battle between the Dawlah group on one side and those who stand with Jarb? and Idr?s [two SNC leaders] on the other, is far from the truth",1
"Those who carried the greatest burden of fighting the Dawlah group in the north are the Islamic Front and Jayshul-Muj?hid?n
[] As for the Islamic Front and Jayshul-Muj?hid?n  two major sides in the battle against the Dawlah group  then it hasnt been conformed to us that theyve fallen into apostasy
We know their condition better than the Dawah group does, this is because of our closeness to them [Wa Law Annahum Faal? M? Y?adh?na Bihi Lak?na Khayran Lahum]",1
"The spark has been lit here in Iraq, and its heat will continue to intensify  by Allahs permission  until it burns the crusader armies in Dabiq
So I swear by the One to Whom I will return, that there is no real jih?d in Iraq except with the presence of the muh?jir?n, the sons of the generous ummah, those who have left their tribes, those who bring victory to Allah and His Messenger (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam)
So beware of losing them, for with their departure will be the departure of your strength, and the departure of the barakah and pleasure of jih?d",1
"You need them and they need you [Ayanqusudd?n wa Ana Hayy]
Im?m Ab? Musab az-Zarq?w? said, Allah has described these strangers with a number of characteristics, among them being that they are nuzz? of the people, or nuzz? from the tribes
The word nuzz? is the plural of naz? and n?zi, which refers to a stranger who breaks off from his family and tribe [meaning he departs and distances himself from them], and the naz?i of the camels are the outsiders",1
"AlHaraw? (rahimahull?h) said, By this he [the Prophet] is referring to the muh?jir?n whove abandoned their homelands and migrated to Allah ta?l? [al-Q?bid?na alal-Jamr]
So we warn the tribes, that any tribe or party or assembly whose involvement and collaboration with the crusaders and their apostate agents are confirmed, then by He who sent Muhammad with the truth, we will target them just as we target the crusaders, and we will eradicate and distinguish them, for there are only two camps: the camp of truth and its followers, and the camp of falsehood and its factions
So choose to be from one of the two camps",1
"And what has occurred with some of the traitors in al-Q?im is the best proof for this [H?dh? Bay?nullinn?s wa li Yundhar? Bih]
From now on, everyone whose affiliation with the pagan guards, police, and army is confirmed, or his collaboration and espionage for the crusaders is verified, then his ruling is execution, and not only that, his house also will be destroyed and burnt, after removal of the women and children
This is in retribution for his treachery towards his religion and ummah, and so that he becomes a manifest lesson and a deterring example [H?dh? Bay?nullinn?s wa li Yundhar? Bih]",1
"Ab? Duj?nah al-Khur?s?n? (may Allah accept him) said, With every death I heard of, I would die
With every illness I got informed of, I would fall ill
With every year that passed of my life, I would grow old a decade of time",1
"This is the Sunnah of Allah concerning the q?id?n (those who sit back and abandon jih?d)
I know this condition well
It is a condition called sentimental death",1
"Therefore, my words will die if I do not save them with my blood
My emotions will be put out if I do not inflame them with my death
My writings will testify against me if I do not produce evidence of my innocence of hypocrisy",1
"Nothing except for blood will fully assure the certainty of any evidence
If Allah were to decree for you to enter the city that my words and feelings live in, you would find my picture hung up on its walls and columns, and beneath my picture written Wanted  Dying or Dead [Mat? Tashrab Kalim?t? min Dim??]
He (rahimahull?h) also said, This love [of jih?d], for those who dont know it, embitters the life of the q?id (one who sits back and abandons jih?d) and destroys his delights",1
"No one will understand my words except for one afflicted with the same condition
[] If the love of jih?d enters a mans heart, then it will not abandon him, even if he wishes so
If he tries to forget or feign forgetfulness, then the symptoms will be aggravated and the condition will be more difficult",1
"He will find himself surrounded by everything that reminds him of jih?d
[] They used to say, Some love kills
I do not find that to be true except with the love of jih?d, for this love will either kill you with sorrow if you decide to sit and abandon jih?d, or it will kill you, making you a martyr f? sab?lill?h if you decide to answer the call",1
"You only have to choose between one of these two deaths [Tal?i Khur?s?n #15]
The spark has been lit here in Iraq, and its heat will continue to intensify  by Allahs permission  until it burns the crusader armies in D?biq
Ab? Musab az-Zarq?w? (rahimahull?h) said, The hypocrites and those who obstruct the path to Allah will say to you, Do you think anything of what you want will ever be achieved? Do you really think that the Islamic Khil?fah or even just the Islamic State will ever be established? That is something that can never happen and it is closer to imagination than reality",1
"So if they say such to you, then remember the statement of Allah ta?l?, {[Remember] when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts was disease said, Their religion has deluded those [Muslims]
But whoever relies upon Allah  then indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise} [Al-Anf?l: 49]
And say to them, Indeed, Allah will grant the Muslims the conquest of Rome, just as Allahs Messenger (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) promised [Was?y? H?mmah Lil Muj?hid?n]",1
"He also said, We perform jih?d here while our eyes are upon al-Quds
We fight here, while our goal is Rome with good expectations concerning Allah that He makes us the keys for the Prophetic good tidings and Godly decrees [Riy?h an-Nasr]
This attitude then was inherited by his successor, Ab? Hamzah al-Muh?jir (rahimahull?h), who said, O muwahhid?n, receive glad tidings, for by Allah, we will not rest from our jih?d until we are under the olive trees of Rome, after we destroy the filthy house called the White House [Inil Hukmu Ill? Lill?h]",1
"This attitude was also echoed by the mountainous man, Ab? Umar al-Baghd?d? (rahimahull?h), who said, O soldiers of the Islamic State, O youth of Muhammad (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) Today we are upon the doorstep for a new era, a turning point for the map of the region, rather the world
Today we witness the end of the lie called western civilization and the rise of the Islamic giant
This is exactly what Bush warned against in his last speech in front of veterans when he said, The region is changing into one that threatens civilization with destruction, meaning the civilization of shirk and kufr, the civilization of usury and prostitution, the civilization of humiliation and subjugation",1
"And he said regarding the soldiers of the Islamic State in Mesopotamia, They strive to reestablish a khil?fah expanding from Spain to Indonesia
This was after he made them the single Sunn? threat towards America and its civilization [Wa Yamkur?na Wa Yamkurull?h]
And he said, This prompted the enemy of Allah  Bush  to say after the blessed rise of the Islamic State, They strive to establish an Islamic State stretching from China to Spain",1
"He spoke the truth although he is a liar [Wa Qul J?al Haqqu Wa Zahaqal B?til]
And this certainty in Allahs promise prompted Ab? Umar al-Baghd?d? to say with full conviction, Inna Dawlatal-Isl?mi B?qiyah (Indeed, the Islamic State will remain) [Has?d as-Sin?n]
And to also say, In the end, I say to the Muslims everywhere who are watching this harsh military and media campaign against the Islamic State in Mesopotamia, do not fear nor worry about the jih?d in Iraq",1
"Expect good, for the harshness of the wave has broken
Indeed, a building constructed upon the skulls of shuhad? and whose earth was cemented with the blood of the virtuous, is a building of truth tougher than the immovable mountains, and a lofty standing more honorable than the stars
And due to His excellence above and beyond any faults, al-Kar?m (the Generous), ar-Rahm?n, ar-Rah?m would never allow their sacrifices to go in vain [Has?d al-Khayr]",1
"This certainty was echoed by Shaykh Ab? Muhammad al-Adn?n? (hafidhahull?h) in his last speech when he said, And so we promise you [O crusaders] by Allahs permission that this campaign will 5 dabiq be your final campaign
It will be broken and defeated, just as all your previous campaigns were broken and defeated, except that this time we will raid you thereafter, and you will never raid us
We will conquer your Rome, break your crosses, and enslave your women, by the permission of Allah, the Exalted",1
"This is His promise to us; He is glorified and He does not fail in His promise
If we do not reach that time, then our children and grandchildren will reach it, and they will sell your sons as slaves at the slave market [Indeed Your Lord Is Ever Watchful]
Shaykh Ab? Musab az-Zarq?w? (rahimahull?h) said, The spark has been lit here in Iraq, and its heat will continue to intensify  by Allahs permission  until it burns the crusader armies in D?biq [Ayna Ahlul Mur??t]",1
"Ab? Hamzah al-Muh?jir (rahimahull?h) said, As for you O knights of tawh?d, monks of the night, lions of the jungle, may Allah reward you on behalf of us and the Muslims with every good
For I have seen war and its men, and I testify by Allah, I testify by Allah, that our ummah in the land of the two grand rivers (Iraq) did not skimp on bestowing its best sons and most truthful nobles upon us
For my eyes have not seen anyone like them, nor have I heard of anyone like them except for the first leading group of Muslims (the Sah?bah)",1
"So I testify that they are the most truthful of people in speech, the most faithful to their promises, the most firm of men, and the strongest in obeying Allah
I do not doubt for a moment  and Allah knows such  that we are the army that will pass on the banner to the slave of Allah the Mahd?
If the first of us is killed, then the last of us will pass it on to him [Sayuhzamul-Jamu Wa Yuwall?nad-Dubur]",1
"Ab? Umar al-Baghd?d? (rahimahull?h) said, The Iraqi Jih?d brought back life to jih?d? regions which had weakened a bit after their strength
It also prepared the path for attacking the Jewish State and retaking Baytul-Maqdis
It is as if I stand before the as?ib (bands) of dabiq Iraq that leave from here to give support to the Mahd? whilst he holds on to the curtains of the Kabah [Has?d as-Sin?n]",1
"O ummah of Islam, when we announced the Islamic State and said that it was a state of hijrah and jih?d, we were not lying against Allah and thereafter against the people, nor were we talking about false dreams, rather, by the bounty of Allah ta?l?, we are more capable of understanding Allahs sunnah in this jih?d
This understanding is derived from the blood of the muj?hid?n amongst the muh?jir?n and ans?r, after we witnessed their character and methodology with our eyes [Has?d as-Sin?n]
I want to remind the fool who is obeyed by his people (Bush) that he was able in a very short period to revive the glory of the ancient Persian Empire",1
"Thus, he became more ominous for his country than Gorbatchev was for his Union (the USSR)
Bush enabled the spreading of Persian (Iranian) influence over Afghanistan after it had been a tough obstacle for the Persians
He seconded with Iraq and opened up its treasures for them while they had not dreamt of drinking a sip of its water",1
"And now they suck up its oil, loot its treasures, and enslave its men
Third, he panicked its r?fid? nusayr? tyrant  through an embargo upon Syria  into opening his country up to hundreds rather thousands of the Persians to nationalize themselves there and become supporters for the agent of the anti-Christ Nasrull?t who is called Nasr Allah and who just emerged from a so-called victory against the pinnacle of the Roman military machine (the Israeli military)
And thus, the ancient Persian empire completed and expanded from Mawarannahr (Transoxiana) to Iran then through Iraq  the location of al-Madain (the imperial capital of Persia)  ending in Sh?m (Syria/Lebanon/Palestine)",1
"So do you think that the Magian Persians will ever be able to repay this fool  Bush  who revived their ancient glory for them without them shooting a single bullet or sacrificing a single soldier? And do you think that the reasonable of the Romans will realize that they have become slaves for the Persians and have become mercenary fighters who fight for them without pay [Inil Hukmu Ill? Lill?h]
To paraphrase Shaykh Anwar al-Awlak? (rahimahull?h), if one wants to know the people of truth, then let him observe where the enemies arrows are aimed
So the world today is divided into two camps",1
"Bush spoke the truth when he said, Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists
I
e",1
"either you are with the crusade or you are with Islam
Bush today is in the frontline carrying a huge cross and treading
I swear by Allah the Great that everyone who treads behind Bush in his plan has apostatized from the religion of Muhammad (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam)",1
"This ruling is from the clearest of rulings in the Book of Allah and Sunnah of the Messenger (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam)
The scholars have said this as I have mentioned before
The proof for this is the statement of Allah subh?nah? wa ta?l? in which he addresses the believers saying, {O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies",1
"They are allies of one another
And whoever is an ally to them among you  then indeed, he is [one] of them
Indeed, Allah guides not the wrongdoing people} [Al-M?idah: 51]",1
"The people of knowledge said, Whoever aligns with the kuff?r has disbelieved
The biggest form of alliance is support whether by statements, spears, or speech
So those who tread behind Bush in his crusade against the Muslims have disbelieved in Allah subh?nah? wa ta?l? and His Messenger",1
"[] So I say to the Muslims, be wary very wary of allying with the Jews and Christians, and whoever has slipped by a word, then let him fear Allah, renew his faith, and repent from his deed
[] Even if he supported them just by a single word
He who aligns with them by a single word falls into apostasy  extreme apostasy, wa l? hawla wa l? quwwata ill? bill?h [Interview  4 Shab?n 1422H]",1
"The spark has been lit here in Iraq, and its heat will continue to intensify  by Allahs permission  until it burns the crusader armies in D?biq
Our war with Kurds is a religious war
It is not a nationalistic war  we seek the refuge of Allah",1
"We do not fight Kurds because they are Kurds
Rather we fight the disbelievers amongst them, the allies of the crusaders and Jews in their war against the Muslims
As for the Muslim Kurds, then they are our people and brothers wherever they may be",1
"We spill our blood to save their blood
The Muslim Kurds in the ranks of the Islamic State are many
They are the toughest of fighters against the disbelievers amongst their people",1
"""As for Yemen, then O alas for what has come upon Yemen
Alas! Alas for Sanaa
The Rafid? Houthis have entered it, but the car bombs have not roasted their skin, nor have the explosive belts and IEDs severed their joints",1
"Is there not in Yemen a person who will take revenge for us from the Houthis? {And if you turn away, He will replace you with another people; then they will not be the likes of you} [Muhammad: 38]
The Khal?fah Ibr?h?m said: We also announce the acceptance of bay?t given by the groups and individuals in all of those mentioned wil?y?t and others
We ask every individual amongst them to join the closest wil?yah to him, and to hear and obey the w?l? appointed by us for it",1

Fight them and overcome them
Be certain that their turn is coming and it will be in your favor, for the R?fidah are a forsaken nation",1

It will remain because the success granted by Allah in this jih?d is more obvious than the sun in the center of the sky",1

It will remain by the truthfulness of the leaders who sacrificed their blood and the truthfulness of the soldiers who established it with their forearms
We consider them as such and Allah is their ultimate judge",1
"It will remain because it is the union of the muj?hid?n and the haven for the oppressed people
It will remain because Islam has begun to ascend and tower, the cloud has begun to scatter, and kufr has begun to be routed and exposed
It will remain because it is the supplication of the oppressed, the tear of the bereaved, the scream of the prisoners, and the hope of the orphans",1
"It will remain because kufr in all its religions and sects gathered against us, and every treacherous person of desire and innovation began to slander and vilify us, so we became certain of the truthfulness of the goal and correctness of the path
It will remain because we are upon certainty that Allah will not break the hearts of the oppressed muwahhid?n and that He will not let the oppressive people gloat over us
It will remain because Allah ta?l? promised in His precise revelation and said,{Allah has promised those who have believed among you and done righteous deeds that He will surely grant them succession [to authority] upon the earth just as He granted it to those before them and that He will surely establish for them [therein] their religion which He has preferred for them and that He will surely substitute for them, after their fear, security} [An-N?r: 55]",1

And indeed, by Allah, we have seen it as a Khil?fah upon the methodology of prophethood
And when we heard the trumpets of the Jews and Christians  the callers upon the gates of Hellfire  we answered the order of Allahs Messenger that obliged sticking to the jam?ah of the Muslims and their Im?m, for Hudhayfah (radiyall?hu anh) said, The people used to ask Allahs Messenger (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) about good, and I used to ask him about evil, fearing that it might overtake me In the had?th, he says, Is there any evil after this good?

"Adh-Dhaw?hir? said, My position concerning the laymen of the Sh?ah is the position of the scholars of Ahlus-Sunnah2 , and that is that they are excused due to their ignorance
As for those of them who take part with their leaders in their cooperation with the crusaders and their aggression towards the Muslims, their ruling then is the ruling of a faction resisting the laws of Islam
3 As for those of their laymen who have not taken part in any aggression towards the Muslims, nor fought under the banner of the global crusade, our approach with them is to make dawah, expose the realities, and clarify the extent of the crimes committed by their leaders against Islam and the Muslims [al-Liq? al-Maft?h  al-Halqat al-?l?]",1
"The officers in the Counter-Religious Activism Department of National Security, who investigate religious issues and torture Muslims, I view them to be kuff?r on an individual level, for they know even more about the Islamic movements than most of the members of these movements themselves
And it is permissible to kill National Security officers and all members of the police  regardless of whether you make takf?r of them on an individual level or you make takf?r of them on a general scale  if that occurs during the course of a campaign of fighting in which sniping them becomes a means for you to cause damage to them for the benefit of the jih?d
This is because a resistant apostate faction is fought as one",1
"It is permissible to kill those of them who are fleeing, and to finish off those of them who are wounded; and this would be an act of killing one whose individual condition was unknown
This is the rule because distinguishing the condition of individuals is done if they are maqd?r alayhim (under the power of Muslims); these individuals are not maqd?r alayhim
So the obligatory defensive jih?d is not to be disrupted for the sake of distinguishing the condition of individuals [al-Liq? al-Maft?h  al-Halqat al-?l?]",1
"He also said, Making takf?r of the armies and the security institutions is an issue that requires elaboration
My view is that the officers in the Counter-Religious Activism Department of National Security and their likes, who investigate Muslims and torture them, are kuff?r on an individual level
The result of the differing on the issue is very minute and is limited to personal rulings, such as marriage and inheritance",1
"However, from the practical perspective regarding fighting them, there is no difference between the two views

"What is Japans concern with us? Who has drawn Japan into this difficult, powerful, and fierce war into this transgression against our sons in Palestine? Japan cannot endure entering into a war against us
Therefore, it should reconsider its stance
What is the concern of Australia in the far south with us and with the condition of the defenseless people of Afghanistan and Palestine? What is Germanys concern in this war except kufr and crusade? It is yet another crusade just like the former crusades led by Richard the Lionheart, Barbarossa of Germany, and Louis of France",1
"Likewise today, when Bush raised the cross, the crusader countries immediately scrambled
What is the Arab countries concern with this crusade? Why have they entered into it nakedly and openly in broad daylight? Because they are pleased with the rule of the cross [October 2001 Interview]
This came at a grave moment during the peak of hardships and difficulties, the harshest of tremors and crises, the forefront of which was the killing of the greatest leaders and symbols of jih?d, those who lit the path for us by their efforts, contribution, and sacrifices, by their blood, skulls, and corpses  Amongst them was the shah?d of Islam  as we consider him  the im?m and sayyid of his era, Ab? Abdill?h Us?mah Ibn L?din, the pride of the Ummah and the crown of its new era",1

I want to restate our position towards the Coptic Christians",1
"We do not want to get into a war with them because we are busy in the battle against the greatest enemy of the Ummah [America] and because they are our partners in this nation, partners whom we wish to live with in peace and stability
We call upon all the soldiers of the Islamic State who are in Khur?s?n to listen to and obey the W?l?, H?fidh Sa?d Kh?n, and his deputy (may Allah preserve them both), and to prepare for the great tribulations they will face
The factions will assemble against you and the rifles and bayonets will multiply against you",1
"But you are up to it, with Allahs permission
Likewise, we renew our call to the muwahhid?n in Europe and the disbelieving West and everywhere else, to target the crusaders in their own lands and wherever they are found
We will argue, before Allah, against any Muslim who has the ability to shed a single drop of crusader blood but does not do so, whether with an explosive device, a bullet, a knife, a car, a rock, or even a boot or a fist",1
"Indeed, you saw what a single Muslim did with Canada and its parliament of shirk, and what our brothers in France, Australia, and Belgium did  may Allah have mercy upon them all and reward them with good on behalf of Islam
And there were many others who killed, ran others over, threatened, frightened, and terrorized people, to the extent that we saw the crusader armies deployed on the streets in Australia, Canada, France, Belgium, and other strongholds of the cross to whom we promise  by Allahs permission  a continuation of their state of alert, terror, fear, and loss of security
And what lies ahead will be worse  with Allahs permission  and more bitter, for you havent seen anything from us just yet",1
"Also, my beloved brothers for the sake of Allah, Id like to make mention of the issue of those who left Jabhat an-Nusrah while their names are known to Jabhat an-Nusrahs Il?miyy?n (media personnel), especially in the northern countryside of Halab
Theres been more than one case where a brother arrives, leaving Jabhat an-Nusrah and coming to join the Islamic State, and his name is immediately handed over to the Free Syrian Army
Consequently, they [the FSA] make things difficult for his family, or his father is thrown in prison, or they threaten to kill his family",1
"Why? Because he joined the ranks of the Islamic State
Many of the leaders in Jabhah try to scare their fighters saying, They [the Islamic State] will kill you
They will do this",1
"They will do that so they can prevent them from coming here [to the Islamic State]
So I advise everyone in Jabhat an-Nusrah, and in particular those young men whom I trained, to join the ranks of the Islamic State, because it is upon the truth, for it implements the Shar?ah of Allah, carries out the hud?d, and enjoins good and forbids evil
As for when I was in Jabhat an-Nusrah, I did not see implementation of Allahs Shar?ah, nor did I see justice between an am?r and an ordinary member",1
"The world today is divided into two camps
Bush spoke the truth when he said, Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists
Meaning, either you are with the crusade or you are with Islam",1
"The former War Minister Ab? Hamzah al-Muh?jir (rahimahull?h) was asked, Some people accuse you of being the cause for the Sahwah mission, how correct is this claim? He replied: We have previously asserted that the true cause behind the Sahwah mission was the establishment of the Islamic State
This is what began to be apparent these days, for after the announcement of the State, the Islamic mission conflicted with the nationalist mission adopted by almost all colors of the spectrum in Iraq, and this is what all the different jabh?t ad-dir?r (harmful fronts) which were announced and formed have declared openly and repeatedly
It is not strange for all these different assemblies to form after the announcement of the Islamic State for they were truly formed only to wage war against it, secretly and openly",1
"Indeed, the rancor and envy of the carriers of ?l Sal?ls banner [the Sur?riyyah] burned after losing their piece of the cake, after their hope for nationalist rule was demolished, and after they realized we would spill our blood and dismember our corpses cheaply so as to not allow the fruit of jih?d to go to waste and so Iraq would not once again be ruled by something besides the Shar?ah of ar-Rahm?n
And because the reality of their armies [the Sur?r? factions] is a lie especially after the sincere ones in their ranks joined us, their only option was to stand with the occupation against the Islamic State because the nationalist mission, which they argued for, gathered support for, and unified for, is the same mission desired by the occupation
The only condition is to be its agents, and this they had offered before for nothing in return from the occupation except a few dirhams and some security, which the occupation and its allies began to deprive them of",1
"The spark has been lit here in Iraq, and its heat will continue to intensify  by Allahs permission  until it burns the crusader armies in D?biq
Shaykh Ab? Musab az-Zarq?w? (rahimahull?h) said, We do not perform jih?d here for a fistful of dirt or an illusory border drawn up by Sykes and Picot
Similarly, we do not perform jih?d for a Western t?gh?t to take the place of an Arab t?gh?t",1
"Rather our jih?d is loftier and more superior
We perform jih?d so that Allahs word becomes supreme and that the religion becomes completely for Allah

"Everyone who opposes this goal or stands in the path of this goal is an enemy for us and a target for our swords, whatever his name may be and whatever his lineage may be

Its statement is decisive and its judgment is not amusement",1
"It is the kinship between us and the people, for our scales  by Allahs grace  are divine, our laws are Qur?nic, and our judgments are upon the prophetic tradition
The American Muslim is our beloved brother
And the k?fir Arab is our despised enemy even if we and he were to have shared the same womb",1
"The Khal?fah (hafidhahull?h) said, O Muslims everywhere, glad tidings to you and expect good
Raise your heads high, for today  by Allahs grace  you have a state and khil?fah, which will return your dignity, might, rights, and leadership
It is a state where the Arab and non-Arab, the white man and black man, the easterner and westerner are all brothers",1
"It is a khil?fah that gathered the Caucasian, Indian, Chinese, Sh?m?, Iraqi, Yemeni, Egyptian, Maghrib? (North African), American, French, German, and Australian
Allah brought their hearts together, and thus, they became brothers by His grace, loving each other for the sake of Allah, standing in a single trench, defending and guarding each other, and sacrificing themselves for one another
Their blood mixed and became one, under a single flag and goal, in one pavilion, enjoying this blessing, the blessing of faithful brotherhood",1
"If kings were to taste this blessing, they would abandon their kingdoms and fight over this grace
All praise and thanks are due to Allah
Therefore, rush O Muslims to your state",1
"Yes, it is your state
Rush, because Syria is not for the Syrians and Iraq is not for the Iraqis

"The Muslims today have a loud, thundering statement, and possess heavy boots
They have a statement that will cause the world to hear and understand the meaning of terrorism, and boots that will trample the idol of nationalism, destroy the idol of democracy, and uncover its deviant nature
Ab? Hamzah al-Muh?jir (rahimahull?h) said in his advice to the nationalist factions of Iraq, To those who fight for the sake of the nation and under the banner of patriotism and nationalism, I say, did not a man come to Ras?lull?h (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam), as reported by al-Bukh?r? and Muslim on the authority of Ab? M?s? (radiyall?hu anh), and say, O Ras?lull?h, what is fighting f? sab?lill?h? One of us might fight out of ghadab (anger) or fight out of hamiyyah (zeal)",1
"So the Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) lifted his head towards him and said, Whoever fights so that the word of Allah becomes supreme, then he has fought f? sab?lill?h (azza wa jall)
An-Nawaw?, Ibn Hajar, and others said that hamiyyah is to fight out of pride, jealousy, or in defense of the clan
Rather, al-H?fidh Ibn Hajar said in Al-Fath, It is possible that fighting out of hamiyyah could mean fighting to repel a harm and that fighting out of ghadab could mean fighting to attain a benefit",1
"So has your fighting, O people, gone beyond what the Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) warned against? Rather, it is the full extent of your purpose, whereas what is demanded by Allahs Shar?ah is just as al-H?fidh Ibn Hajar said in AlFath, Fighting is not f? sab?lill?h unless the only purpose of his fighting is to make Allahs word supreme
Liberating the nation and other goals enter into this as a consequence but not as the purpose
You have known the harm in this form of fighting, as most of the Arab rulers today came to power after wars under the banners of nationalism",1
"How do you see the outcome? Is it not loss in the Duny? and Hereafter?
Am?rul-Mumin?n Ab? Umar al-Baghd?d? (rahimahull?h) said, The idea of nationalism and patriotism contradicts the religion in a number of its fundamentals
First, preferring people to others is in accordance with their piety not their blood",1
"Allah (ta?l?) said, {O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and dabiq 7 8 ARTICLE THE ALLIES OF AL-Q?IDAH IN SH?M made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another
Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you} [Al-Hujur?t: 13]
Second, it contradicts the creed of wal? and bar?  a great fundamental of the religion  and uproots it",1
"The Arab Iraqi Christian is their brother who has all rights whereas the Indian or Turkish Muslim has no rights
The Shar?ah of these people necessitates preferring Uqbah Ibn Ab? Muayt and Ab? Jahl to Bil?l the Ethiopian and Salm?n the Persian
Third, it opposes the bond between the believers",1
"Ras?lull?h (sallall?hu alahyi wa sallam) said, The believer to the believer is like a building, each part holding up the other [Reported by al-Bukh?r? and Muslim on the authority of Ab? M?s? al-Ashar?]
He (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) also said, The example of the believers with regards to their love, mercy, and sympathy is like that of a single body, if a limb feels pain, the rest of the body responds to it with sleeplessness and fever [Reported by al-Bukh?r? and Muslim on the authority of an-Num?n Ibn Bash?r]
Fourth, it is based upon the dawah to j?hiliyyah and partisanship",1
"Allah (ta?l?) said, {When those who disbelieved had put into their hearts hamiyyah  the hamiyyah of J?hiliyyah} [Al-Fath: 26]
Ras?lull?h (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) said, Whoever calls to asabiyyah (factionalism) is not one of us [Reported by Ab? D?w?d on the authority of Jubayr Ibn Mutim]
Am?rul-Mumin?n Ab? Umar al-Baghd?d? (rahimahull?h) also said, Sadly, some of the fledglings of secularism spread the occupations lie, formulated a basis for it, argued in favor of it, and raised the banner of blindness in the name of nationalism and patriotism, both of which are exactly what the Magian state constitution entails",1
"They made the resources of Iraq  especially the water and oil  the property of those who possess Iraqi citizenship! So what if Ras?lull?h (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) were to migrate to our lands? Indeed, he (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) migrated to a land other than his and settled in a home other than his
So are those resources hal?l for him and his Companions in accordance with the doctrine of these people? No
As for him (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) and the muh?jir?n after him having authority and leadership, then for that to occur would necessitate facing the harshest of opposition from these people! How not, when these people are those who said, Iraq is for all the Iraqis and its resources are the property of all the Iraqis",1
"Yes, for all of the Iraqis, even if they are from the Yaz?d? devil worshippers or Sabian Mandaeans
All of them according to them have equal rights whether he is a Sunn? Muslim or R?fid? Magian! It does not concern him whether this Iraqi worships our Glorious Lord or a rebellious devil
His right will be protected! O muwahhid?n, our creed is that a Muslim is our brother even if he is a Filipino Asian and that the devil worshipper is our enemy even if he is definitely Iraqi",1
"The Islamic States spokesman, Shaykh Ab? Muhammad al-Adn?n? (hafidhahull?h), said, And we bring you the good news today of the Khil?fahs expansion to West Africa, for the Khal?fah (hafidhahull?h) has accepted the pledge of allegiance made by our brothers in Jam?at Ahlis-Sunnah lid-Dawah wal-Jih?d
We congratulate the Muslims and our muj?hid brothers in West Africa on their pledge of allegiance, and we congratulate them on joining the caravan of the Khil?fah
So rejoice, O Muslims, for this is a new door that Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, has opened so that you may migrate to the land of Islam and so that you may wage jih?d",1
"So whoever is stopped by the disbelieving rulers, and prevented from emigrating to Iraq, Sh?m, Yemen, the Arabian Peninsula, or Khur?s?n, will not be prevented  by Allahs permission  from emigrating to Africa
So come, O Muslims, to your State, for we call on you to mobilize for jih?d and incite you and invite you to emigrate to your brothers in West Africa
And we specifically call upon the students of Islamic knowledge and the callers to Islam",1
"Come forth, O Muslims, to the land of the Caliphate
Ab? Musab as-S?r?, for example, said, The Muslim Brotherhood movement is truly as they claim the mother group that gave birth to the majority of the fundamentalist political movements and even many of the jih?d? movements in the Arab and Islamic world [Dawat al-Muq?wamah]
He also said, The Muslim Brotherhood movement was the main natural incubator from which it was possible for jih?d? thought to spread, for the dawah of Hasan al-Bann? was an appropriate environment for such development",1
"Nothing shows such as much as the Brotherhood slogan that described the Ikw?n? methodology in brief: Allah is our goal
The Messenger is our role model
The Qur?n is our constitution",1
"Jih?d is our path
Death for Allahs cause is our greatest aspiration  Its initial jih?d? practices were also a proof of it being the appropriate incubator for the birth of the jih?d? movement and ideology from its womb [Dawat al-Muq?wamah]
He also said, The aspect of jih?d? creed was present in most of these calls [for comprehensive reform] and there is nothing more indicative of this than the famous slogan of the mother and heart of all the Islamic movements  the call of the Muslim Brotherhood and the various movements it gave birth to in the Arab and Islamic world  I cannot find in the eloquent works of any author of this modern Ummah who more comprehensively gathered the basis of the jih?d creed as it was gathered in the Ikhw?ns slogan, which encompassed all aspects, principles, and branches of the religion [Dawat al-Muq?wamah]",1
"He also said, The revolutionary ideology of the jih?d movement and its first ideological incubator  I mean the ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood  mainly entered the Arab and Islamic world from Egypt and Syria
This organizational ideology that was formed inside the Muslim Brotherhood movementwas one of the two halves of the composition of the ideology of the modern jih?d? movement [Dawat al-Muq?wamah]
The spark has been lit here in Iraq, and its heat will continue to intensify  by Allahs permission  until it burns the crusader armies in D?biq",1
"As-S?r? said, As for the practitioners of democracy, then they are of different types
Thus, the rule upon them differs
But in general, I believe in the opinion that says that those who believe the philosophy and legislations of democracy to be kufr and contrary to the creed of Islam and religion of tawh?d but practice it under the pretense of being weak and it being the only available means to achieve interests they believe to serve the dawah, Islam, and the Muslims and that it is the viable way to reach the implementation of the Shar?ah in these circumstances and abolish what opposes the Shar?ah, or that it is the potential path to declare the truth, command the good, forbid the evil, and pass the voice of truth to the Ummah, and so forth, then the sincere people amongst them are excused in their practice of democracy and joining of its institutions due to their wrong misunderstanding [Dawat al-Muq?wamah]! As-S?r? said, The Jih?d? Creed and the Constitution of the International Islamic Resistance Call:  Article 19: The international Islamic call considers the efforts of all the sincere ones within the Islamic awakening  the dawah, reform, educational, religious, and other efforts approved of by the Shar?ah  that the various schools of the Islamic awakening practice includingthe Muslim Brotherhoodto be deserving of gratitude due to their preservation of the Muslims religion and improvement of their conditions",1
"It calls them to cooperate in righteousness and piety and to support the resistance
It considers their efforts in dawah to Allahs religion to be a support for and solidification of the roots of resistance within this Ummah and a preservation of its composition
It calls everyone to overlook the points of difference at this stage in which the existence of all Muslims is at threat on all cultural levels [Dawat al-Muq?wamah]",1
"As-S?r? said, Harmful matters manifested in the works of at-Tal?ah
That was their inclination  especially Adn?n Uqlah and some of his students  towards extremism, particularly after the Ikhw?n took the odd path of the coalition and a new political media campaign, after the Ikhw?n had solidified Adn?ns stance by their insistence on boycotting at-Tal?ah and holding enmity towards it
So Adn?n Uqlah declared his takf?r of those leaders of the Muslim Brotherhoodthat approved of the National Coalition [of the eighties] and what it entailed of corruption",1
"What pushed him to this was some of the truly corrupt publications of the National Coalition, which obviously included the Ikhw?n!  And despite a number of reasonable figures standing in the face of this extreme path of takf?r of others, Adn?n stuck to his conviction while having plausible claims that he would repeat regularly
He was followed by numerous members of at-Tal?ah on his opinion [At-Thawrah al-Isl?miyyah al-Jih?diyyah f? S?riy?]
He also described one of the negative points in the experience of at-Tal?ah as being, The inclination of at-Tal?ah towards extremism in its last days as a result of the Ikhw?n? and Iraqi boycott, the conspiracy of all parties against it, and what it clearly faced of oppression and violence",1
"This extremism was a constant trait of everyone who belonged to at-Tal?ah
The Ikhw?n? media played a major role in exaggerating this extremism to use it against at-Tal?ah, but undoubtedly at-Tal?ah had some obvious extremism
Probably the most extreme of what it delved into was the conviction that Adn?n Uqlah and some of his companions reached in pronouncing takf?r upon those of the Muslim Brotherhoodwho gave verdicts in support of the National Coalition and approved of it as an idea and program",1
"He would pronounce takf?r upon everyone to whom the condition of the coalition was proved and then insisted upon his loyalty to the leadership and its coalition
Adn?n Uqlah had some claims for his conviction found in the publications of the coalition and the statements of some of the Ikhw?n, especially Adn?n Sad ad-D?n, who said in one of his interviews that he considered the members of the Iraqi Baath party  the rightwing Aflaq party  to be Muslims and its leadership to be religious
Rather, Sad ad-D?n declared on more than one occasion his conviction that Saddam Hussein is Muslim and his regime is Islamic! Rather, Sad ad-D?n even criticized those youth who described Saddam with kufr and requested these youth repent from such beliefs",1
"Still, despite these statements giving claim for Adn?n Uqlahs conviction, undoubtedly the generalization he adopted was extreme! [At-Thawrah al-Isl?miyyah al-Jih?diyyah f? S?riy?]
He said, O Muslims! Whoever thinks that it is within his capacity to conciliate with the Jews, Christians, and other kuff?r, and for them to conciliate with him, such that he coexists with them and they coexist with him while he is upon his religion and upon tawh?d, then he has belied the explicit statement of his Lord (azza wa jall), who says,  {And they will continue to fight you until they turn you back from your religion if they are able} [Al-Baqarah: 217]  So this is the condition of the kuff?r in dealing with the Muslims until the establishment of the Hour
{And you will never find in the way of Allah any alteration} [F?tir: 43]",1
"He also said, O Muslims, Islam was never for a day the religion of peace
Islam is the religion of war
Your Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) was dispatched with the sword as a mercy to the creation",1
"He was ordered with war until Allah is worshipped alone
He (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) said to the mushrik?n of his people, I came to you with slaughter [Reported by Im?m Ahmad from Abdull?h Ibn Amr]
He fought both the Arabs and non-Arabs in all their various colors",1
"He himself left to fight and took part in dozens of battles
He never for a day grew tired of war  His companions after him and their followers carried on similarly
They did not soften nor abandon war, until they possessed the Earth, conquered the East and the West, the nations submitted to them, and the lands yielded to them, by the edge of the sword",1
"And similarly, this will remain the condition of those who follow them until the Day of Recompense
Our Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) has informed us of the Mal?him near the end of time
He gave us good tidings and promised us that we would be victorious in these battles",1
"He is the truthful and trustworthy, sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam
And here we are today seeing the signs of those Mal?him and we feel the winds of victory within them
He said, Indeed, fighting the kuff?r, hijrah, and jih?d will remain until the establishment of the Hour",1
"Allahs Messenger (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) said, Hijrah will not cease to exist until repentance ceases to be accepted, and repentance will not cease to be accepted until the sun rises from the West [Reported by Ab? D?w?d from Mu?wiyah]  He (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) also said, There will not cease to exist a group from my nation fighting upon the truth, manifest until the Day of Judgment
Then, ?s?, son of Maryam, will descend, and their leader will say, Come and lead us in prayer
So he will say, No",1
"You are leaders over one another as an honor from Allah for this nation [Reported by Muslim from J?bir]
He described the imminent extinction of the grayzone by saying, And if the Crusaders today claim to avoid the Muslim public and to confine themselves to targeting the armed amongst them, then soon you will see them targeting every Muslim everywhere
And if the Crusaders today have begun to trouble the Muslims who continue to live in the lands of the cross by monitoring them, arresting them, and questioning them, then soon they will begin to displace them and take them away either dead, imprisoned, or homeless",1
"They will not leave anyone amongst them except one who apostatizes from his religion and follows theirs
And you will remember what I now say to you, and I entrust my affair to Allah
O Muslims, the Jews, the Christians, and the rest of the kuff?r will not approve of you nor abandon waging war against you until you follow their religion and apostatize from yours",1
"He then expounded on the obligation upon the Muslims during these wars before the Hour
He said, O Muslims! Do not think the war that we are waging is the Islamic States war alone
Rather, it is the Muslims war altogether",1
"It is the war of every Muslim in every place, and the Islamic State is merely the spearhead in this war
It is but the war of the people of faith against the people of kufr, so march forth to your war O Muslims
March forth everywhere, for it is an obligation upon every Muslim who is accountable before Allah  There is no excuse for any Muslim who is capable of performing hijrah to the Islamic State, or capable of carrying a weapon where he is, for Allah (tab?raka wa ta?l?) has commanded him with hijrah and jih?d, and has made fighting obligatory upon him",1
"And we call upon every Muslim in every place to perform hijrah to the Islamic State or fight in his land wherever that may be
He then warned against the propaganda of the crusaders by saying, America and its allies from amongst the Jews, Crusaders, R?fidah, secularists, atheists, and apostates claim that their coalition and war is to aid the weak and oppressed, help the poor, relieve the afflicted, liberate the enslaved, defend the innocent and peaceful, and prevent the shedding of their blood
They also claim to be in the camp of truth, good, and justice, waging war against falsehood, evil, and oppression, alongside the Muslims! Rather, they claim to defend Islam and the Muslims! Indeed, they lie",1
"He then expounded in detail on the apathy of the t?gh?t rulers towards the Muslims and followed by saying, The Arabian Peninsulas rulers have been exposed and disgraced and have lost their supposed legitimacy
Their treachery has become clear even to the laymen of the Muslims
And the reality of these rulers thereby became apparent",1
"Therefore, their masters from amongst the Jews and Crusaders had no more use for them
And so their masters began to replace them with the Safaw? R?fidah and the Kurdish atheists
When ?l Sal?l realized their masters abandonment of them, their disposal of them like tattered shoes, and their replacement of them, they launched their supposed war against the R?fidah of Yemen",1
"And it is not a storm of resolve, rather it is the kick of a dying person, by Allahs permission, as he struggles during his last breaths
He then said, Today they claim to defend AhlusSunnah in Yemen against the R?fidah! Rather, they have lied, failed, and lost
Their war is nothing but an attempt to prove themselves once again to their masters from amongst the Jews and Crusaders",1
"It is nothing but a desperate attempt to turn the Muslims away from the Islamic State whose voice The crusaders seek to bridge their relations with R?fid? Iran at the expense of crusader relations with the Arab taw?gh?t 56 FEATURE is high everywhere and whose reality has become clear to all the Muslims and therefore the Muslims began to gradually rally around it
Their storm is nothing but a storm of delusion after the fire of the R?fidah scorched their thrones and after the R?fidahs march reached the people of the Arabian Peninsula, a matter that will lead thereafter to the Muslim public in the Arabian Peninsula rallying around the Islamic State since it defends them against the R?fidah
This is what frightens ?l Sal?l and the rulers of the Arabian Peninsula and makes their thrones tremble",1
"This is the secret of their supposed storm, which, by Allahs permission, will be their imminent end, for ?l Sal?l and the rulers of the Arabian Peninsula are not people of war nor do they have the patience for it
Rather, they are people of luxury and extravagance, people of intoxication, prostitution, dances, and feasts
They have become accustomed to the defense of the Jews and Crusaders for them and their hearts have drunk humiliation, disgrace, and subservience",1
"He also called the Muslims to recognize the reality of this war
O Muslims everywhere, has the time not come for you to realize the truth of the conflict and that it is between kufr and ?m?n? See on which front the rulers of your lands stand and to which camp they belong
Has the time not come O Ahlus-Sunnah for you to know that you alone are the targets? This war is only against you and against your religion",1
"Has the time not come for you to return to your religion and your jih?d and thereby bring back your glory, honor, rights, and leadership? Has the time not come for you to know that there is no might nor honor nor safety nor rights for you except in the shade of the Khil?fah?
He said, O Ahlus-Sunnah in Iraq  seek shelter  after Allah  with the Islamic State
What do you wait for after the truth has become clearer than the day and after the spiteful R?fidah exposed their reality? Here they are today slaughtering everyone considered from AhlusSunnah in Baghdad and elsewhere",1
"No one was saved from them, even their allies, supporters, aids, tails, and dogs from the apostates who had once belonged to Ahlus-Sunnah, those in the Sahwah, army, police, and elsewhere, those whom the evil scholars confused into fleeing the implementation of Allahs law in the territory of the Islamic State
So they became homeless, humiliated, fearful, and worrisome of the R?fidahs cruelty, whereas the Muslims live in the territory of the Islamic State with might and honor, secure by Allahs bounty alone, with a life of comfort, going about the affairs of their business, livelihood, and trade, enjoying the grace of living under the rule of their Lords law, and all praise and grace is Allahs
Therefore, O Muslims, seek shelter  after Allah  with the Islamic State",1
"He also warned of the possible attempt of the kuff?r to strike against the Islamic State wil?y?t in Sh?m before those in Iraq
Be patient and firm, and be cautious, for the enemies of Allah are mobilizing, thundering, increasing, and threatening the people of Mosul
We believe that their mobilization will be for ar-Raqqah and Halab before Mosul",1
"So be cautious
Finally, he explained the growing weakness of the modern crusaders
O soldiers of the Islamic State, be firm, for you are upon the truth",1
"Seek help through patience, for victory comes with patience and triumph is for those who are patient
Be patient, because the Crusaders are bleeding to death, the R?fidah are faltering, and the Jews are horrified and in dread
Your enemies have become weaker than they were yesterday  by Allahs grace  and are growing weaker and weaker, and all praise be to Allah",1
"The spark has been lit here in Iraq, and its heat will continue to intensify  by Allahs permission  until it burns the crusader armies in D?biq

So O muwahhid, wherever you may be, what are you going to do to support your brothers? What do you wait for as the people have become two encampments and the heat of the war increases day by day? O muwahhid, we call you up to defend the Islamic State",1
"Dozens of nations have gathered against it
They began their war against us at all levels
So rise O muwahhid",1
"Rise and defend your state from your place wherever you may be
Shaykh Ab? Muhammad al-Adn?n? highlighted their tough stance against the murtadd?n from amongst their people stating, Finally, we do not want to forget to direct a message towards our Muslim people and brothers from the Kurds in Iraq, Sh?m, and elsewhere
Our war with the Kurds is a religious war",1
"It is not a nationalistic war  we seek the refuge of Allah
We do not fight Kurds because they are Kurds
Rather we fight the kuff?r amongst them, the allies of the crusaders and Jews in their war against the Muslims",1
"As for the Muslim Kurds, then they are our people and brothers wherever they may be
We spill our blood to save their blood
The Muslim Kurds in the ranks of the Islamic State are many",1
"They are the toughest of fighters against the kuff?r amongst their people

We congratulate them on their bayah and their joining of the ranks of the Khil?fah",1
"Am?rul-Mumin?n has 1 See the report titled Wil?yat Khur?s?n and the Bay?t from Qawq?z on page 35 of Dabiq issue #7
accepted your bayah and has appointed the noble Shaykh Ab? Muhammad al-Qadar? as W?l? over al-Qawq?z and advised him to have taqw? of Allah both in his private and public affairs as well as with kindness and softness towards those with him

The Muj?hid Shaykh Ab? Muhammad al-Adn?n? ash-Sh?m?  may Allah protect him and make him a thorn in the throats of the apostates, mun?fiq?n, and theorists  said, We likewise renew our call to the soldiers of the factions in Sh?m and Libya

"Remember, O you afflicted by fitnah, before embarking to fight the Islamic State, that there is no place on the face of the Earth where the Shar?ah of Allah is implemented and the rule is entirely for Allah except for the lands of the Islamic State
Remember that if you were able to capture one hand span, one village, or one city from it, the law of Allah in that area would be replaced with the laws of men
Then ask yourself, What is the ruling on someone who replaces or is a cause for the replacement of the law of Allah with the law of man? Yes, you become a k?fir because of that",1
"So beware, for by fighting the Islamic State you fall into kufr whether you realize it or not
Now we return to what the official speaker of the Islamic State said in his last speech O Our People Respond to the Caller of Allah, Remember, O you afflicted by fitnah, before embarking to fight the Islamic State, that there is no place on the face of the Earth where the Shar?ah of Allah is implemented and the rule is entirely for Allah except for the lands of the Islamic State

The spark has been lit here in Iraq, and its heat will continue to intensify  by Allahs permission  until it burns the crusader armies in D?biq",1
"Their readiness to sacrifice for the sake of Allah to defend their non-Arab brothers is exemplified in the words of Shaykh Ab? Musab az-Zarq?w? who once stated, We perform jih?d so that Allahs word becomes supreme and the religion becomes completely for Allah
{And fight them until there is no fitnah and [until] the religion, all of it, is for Allah} [Al-Anf?l: 39]
Everyone who opposes this goal or stands in the path of this goal is an enemy to us and a target for our swords, whatever his name may be and whatever his lineage may be",1
"We have a religion that Allah revealed to be a scale and a judge
Its statement is decisive and its judgment is not amusement
It is the kinship between us and the people, for our scales  by Allahs grace  are divine, our laws are Qur?nic, and our judgments are upon the prophetic tradition",1
"The American Muslim is our beloved brother, and the k?fir Arab is our despised enemy even if he and we were to have shared the same womb
O Muslims everywhere, glad tidings to you and expect good
Raise your head high, for today  by Allahs grace  you have a state and khil?fah, which will return your dignity, might, rights, and leadership",1
"It is a state where the Arab and non-Arab, the white man and black man, the easterner and westerner are all brothers
It is a khil?fah that gathered the Caucasian, Indian, Chinese, Sh?m?, Iraqi, Yemeni, Egyptian, Maghrib? (North African), American, French, German, and Australian
Allah brought their hearts together, and thus, they became brothers by His grace, loving each other for the sake of Allah, standing in a single trench, defending and guarding each other, and sacrificing themselves for one another",1
"Their blood mixed and became one, under a single flag and goal, in one pavilion, enjoying this blessing, the blessing of faithful brotherhood
If kings were to taste this blessing, they would abandon their kingdoms and fight over this grace
So all praise and thanks are due to Allah",1
"Therefore, rush O Muslims to your state
Yes, it is your state
Rush, because Syria is not for the Syrians, and Iraq is not for the Iraqis",1

By Allah, we have come to you with the sons of Ab? Ubaydah
By Allah! By Allah! You will not enjoy safety and security, and you will not have a comfortable life as long as you wage war against Islam and the Muslims and remain as tails of the West, which plays around with you as it pleases",1

And as for you, O soldiers of the t?gh?t who serve to secure his throne, by Allah, you will not enjoy a pleasant life as long as you serve as guards for the one whose planes, together with the West, bomb our brothers, and as long as you serve as his minions, imprisoning our brothers and sisters, waging war against Ahlus-Sunnah and making peace with the R?fidah
So receive glad tidings of that which will ruin your lives",1
"By Allah, you will not be safe, O soldier, neither in your home nor on the streets
We will lie in wait for you at every place of ambush
We have come to you with men who love death just as you love life, and race one another to fight you just as you compete with one another to attain higher positions, O you cowards",1
"My second message is to the zealous lions

Strike with istishh?d? operations and explosive belts! These istishh?d? operations have proven their benefit and have produced their fruits

"They have planted terror in their hearts, so much so that the enemies of Allah are now afraid of everything and wait for death to come to them from every direction
In addition to that, they result in the least amount of loss out of all the shar? methods of fighting, while at the same time being the most effective
This is the advice that I wished to convey to my brothers in the Peninsula of Muhammad ?",1
"{And Allah is predominant over His affair, but most of the people do not know} [Yusuf: 21]

"In the first press release made by this council on 13 April 2015, only nine days after al-Mukall? was overrun by alQ?idah, they said, O free sons of Hadramawt, in light of the painful circumstances that the country in general faces, including the province of Hadramawt, especially its capital al-Mukall?, the Council of the Scholars of Ahlus-Sunnah, the tribal elders, and a party of prominent figures and seniors took the initiative to repair the lands and protect them from slipping into bloody conflicts
A meeting occurred in which the Hadhrami Domestic Council was formed to become an authority in administering the affairs of the provincial capital and in coordination with and under the supervision of the governor of Hadramawt Province, Dr
?dil Muhammad B?ham?d",1
"With success granted by Allah, the council reached an agreement with the Sons of Hadramawt consisting of the following: First, they have to hand over all the public utilities and the administration of them to the Hadhrami Domestic Council
It is also the right of the Domestic Council to appoint whom it wishes as its head
Second, the Domestic Council is responsible for administrating the matter of public security and its stations",1
"Third, what is needed to facilitate the job of the Council and administer services will be provided by the Sons of Hadramawt to the Domestic Council, as agreed by both sides  The council calls  all the directors of offices and all the civil and security bodies to pursue their work under the supervision of the council  The council also commends the efforts of Operation Decisive Storm under the leadership of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Cooperation Council to deter the aggression of the Houthis and their allies
In a press release on 16 June 2015, they said, On the occasion of the arrival of the blessed month of Ramad?n, the leaders and members of the Hadhrami Domestic Council  send special greetings and great thanks to the Servant of the Noble Haramayn and all the leaders of the Gulf states
In a press release on 4 September 2015, they said, We will not miss the opportunity in this declaration to offer condolences to our brothers in the coalition of Arab nations with respect to the victims resulting from a treacherous attack that led to the deaths of sixty Emirati, Saudi, and Bahraini soldiers",1
"We ask Allah c to accept them as shuhad? as they defended their nations  We convey to them the Al-Mukall? - After capturing this city from one group of murtadd?n, al-Q?idah handed it over to another group of murtadd?n 7 condolences of the people of Hadramawt for the families of the shuhad? and their hope for their wounded to quickly recover
In an announcement released on 21 April 2015, the council said, Since  the collapse of all the institutions of the state, army, and security, and the control of those who call themselves The Sons of Hadramawt over the affairs of the provincial capital, and after constant communication with the governor of the province of Hadramawt  the scholars, tribal elders, and notables placed their exhaustive efforts into convincing The Sons of Hadramawt of the danger of their remaining in control of the political offices of the government and its other buildings, something that could lead to regional and international military interference whose outcome would be disastrous for the people and land
These efforts resulted in an agreement decreeing the handover of all government facilities and public security centers to a domestic Hadhrami council formed by scholars and tribal nobles  They go on to say, The brother, the governor of the Hadramawt province, blessed this agreement; rather he initially agreed to be the head of the council",1
"He later proposed being a coordinator and supervisor over the council
After a few days, the armed forces defending the airport, ad-Dabbah, Brigade 27, and Air force Brigade 190 all withdrew
It is not true that the Domestic Hadhrami Council received these camps and handed them over to The Sons of Hadramawt",1
"Rather, the Sons of Hadramawt overran them first
Because of these events, an emergency meeting was held by the Domestic Council on 29/6/1436AH coinciding with 18 April 2015
The following resolutions were made there: First resolution: The negotiations between the Domestic Council and The Sons of Hadramawt will continue",1
"The seizing of control over the public facilities and the responsibility to administer the affairs of the provincial capital will not be complete until The Sons of Hadramawt abide by the following conditions
They must: A) Gradually hand over all the government facilities to the Domestic Council
B) Hand over the seaport, the airport, and the military camps to the Domestic Council",1
"C) Hand over sufficient amounts and sufficient types of vehicles, weapons, and munitions (in accordance with the demands of the councils security committee) to enable the achievement of the councils duties in maintaining public security and military posts
D) Return at least two billion riyals from the money that was taken from the Central Bank to the Domestic Council for the council to manage the affairs of the province
E) Not execute arrests or house raids after the Domestic Council takes authority except if it is proven that an individual works against the security of the province",1
"The second resolution: Communication with the President and Vice President of the Republic, the Prime Minister, and the governor of the province will continue until a declaration is released in which they announce their support of the Domestic Council so as to achieve security, stability, and normalization of affairs in Hadramawt The results of the negotiations with The Sons of Hadramawt were as follows: The Sons of Hadramawt agreed to hand over the public facilities and the administration of these facilities whenever the Domestic Council requests so
The Sons of Hadramawt agreed to hand over the seaport, the airport, and the military camps, except for Brigade 27, to the Domestic Council  The Sons of Hadramawt agreed to provide the Domestic Council with a sufficient amount of vehicles, weapons, emergency vehicles, and police vehicles, so as to facilitate the job of the councils security committee  The Sons of Hadramawt agreed to stop carrying out any arrests or house raids after the Domestic Council takes authority of the city unless the danger of an individual against the security of Hadramawt is certain
I am pleased to present my advice to the muj?hid?n in particular, and the Muslims in general through Sawtul-Jih?d magazine",1
"The first piece of advice  following my advice to fear Allah and be mindful of Him  is to listen to and obey those whom Allah has given authority over the affairs of the muj?hid?n
The Ummah today has been afflicted by the treacherous, apostate rulers and leaders who have even violated the rights of Allah in addition to the rights of His creation
And it is known that the authority of these rulers is invalid, and that it is obligatory to oppose them and wage war against them",1
"But what is meant by listening and obeying here is in reference to those whom Allah has given authority over the affairs of jih?d [and now, the Khil?fah]
This is a very important and very serious matter, which the Wise legislator has urged
And His Messenger g has made disobedience of ones leader similar to disobedience of the Prophet g",1
"Listening and obeying is from unity, cooperation, and strength, in contrast with quarrelling, disunity, and disagreement
Quarrelling and disagreement in jih?d is considered a means of failure and defeat
{And do not dispute and [thus] lose courage and [then] your strength would depart; and be patient",1
"Indeed, Allah is with the patient} [Al-Anf?l: 46]
He who studies history and S?rah sees that disobeying the leader  in any form  has a severe, adverse consequence, and the best example of that is what happened to the Sah?- bah in the Battle of Uhud when they disobeyed the Prophet g and as a result, the Muslim army suffered a setback and calamity, including many of the best Sah?bah being killed, and the Prophet g and a number of other Sah?bah being wounded
This was all the result of disobeying the leader, the Prophet g",1
"And how many times has a leader been disobeyed in some of the lands and arenas of jih?d, and the price paid as a result was calamity and tribulation that included blood being spilled and lives being lost, for disobeying the leader is not merely a sin that affects the sinner alone
Rather, it affects the entire group, and most of the time the entire army
How many times has a muj?hid brother been ordered by his leader not to go to a certain area, but he disobeys the leader and as a result he lands in captivity! And how many times has a brother disobeyed the leader with respect to security measures and precautions, and as a result he and a group of his brothers land in captivity! There are many instances where a group of brothers were taken captive or arrested because one of them disobeyed the security precautions they were instructed with by the am?r",1
"One of the many small examples mentioned in this regard is an incident that was related to me by one of the brothers about a man who wanted to join the training camps in Afghanistan
The person responsible for his departure gave him instructions not to call his family until he reached Pakistan
But the brother disobeyed this order and called his family from the airport in his country just before boarding the plane",1
"Immediately, his family hastened to speak to the airport officials and managed to catch him before the plane took off
So he paid the price of disobedience by being deprived of preparing for and undertaking jih?d for Allahs cause! There are many such incidents, but here I would like to advise the brothers who have refused to live a life of humiliation and have overcome their desires and lusts, to fasten on themselves the bridle of listening to and obeying the leaders in everything big and small, for obedience is in everything except in sin
And if the leaders order is an issue of ijtih?d where there are two or more legitimate opinions and the leader has adopted one of the opinions  regardless of whether it is the more correct or the less correct opinion  it is obligatory to yield to the opinion he has chosen and submit to his order, because the issue is an issue of ijtih?d and there is no denunciation in that",1
"And beware of looking for loopholes to avoid obeying the order to the letter, as they are the causes of grief and calamity
Whenever someone wants to disobey the leader, if he were to look for an excuse for himself he would find it
So those who disobeyed the Prophet g in the Battle of Uhud, their excuse was that the battle was over and there was no longer any point in remaining on the archers mountain, and so on and so forth So do not look for excuses when you are thinking of disobeying the order, but rather compel yourself to follow the order and not overstep it",1
"It is sad to see that the people of falsehood and the armies of the taw?gh?t listen and obey and that they are relatively disciplined
You would see one of them committing a sin - even committing kufr - and if he were asked about it he would foolishly say, Im a slave whos been given orders! Whereas you find that listening to and obeying the leader [who does not order with sin] is a matter that is somewhat lost and weak when it comes to the muj?hid?n
Wall?hul-Musta?n It is obligatory on you, my noble brother, to harshly denounce anyone who disobeys the leader, and to assist your leader and your brothers in preventing any disobedience and mistake that the Ummah and the muj?hid?n would pay the price for",1
"And know, O blessed one, that listening and obeying is from being humble towards the believers, and that to violate this is to be harsh on the believers! I conclude my advice with the following poetry: Listen to my truthful advice, for indeed I want good and benefit for you, O my brother
Your obedience to your leader is an essential necessity, and whoever disobeys his order commits a sin
To listen to and obey the leader is to listen to the command of Muhammad, the conveyer of glad tidings",1
"As for opposing the command and disobeying, then it is a sin against the Judge (Allah)
And it is the foundation of weakness and defeat, and leads to corrupt opinions and loss of resolve
And what occurred to the Sah?bah in the Battle of Uhud is forever a lesson for every believer",1
"So adhere to and be diligent in obedience and dont get tired
Listen both in times of dislike and delight, Unless the leaders order is against the Shar?ah, for there is no obedience to the leader in such
I ask Allah to help both me and you, my brother, in listening and obeying, and to not to make us a cause for any harm to befall our brothers through our sins, and to forgive us if we forget or make mistakes",1
"On 15 September 2015, a declaration was released by the Syrian revolutionary factions in which they said: The representatives of the Syrian revolutionary fighting factions have met together and discussed the presidential statement by the UN Security Council issued on August 17, 2015, as well as the plan proposed by the UN envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura
The meeting factions have acknowledged that the statement by the UN Security Council could provide an enabling environment for starting an objective political negotiation and trust-building among all parties
The meeting factions have reached a consensus on the following: 1",1
"We welcome the call to start a political process that leads to a political transition according to the Geneva Communiqu that stipulates establishing a transitional governing body that starts functioning as soon as an agreement on a solution is reached, and thus, performing all executive authorities, including those of the President of the Republic
2
We emphasize the precondition of the departure of Bashar al-Assad and all the pillars of his regime, and that none of them would have a place or a role in the new Syria or the transitional phase",1
"We consider this as a basic precondition for carrying out any political process
3
Implementing the resolution 2139 that calls for all parties to stop waging any attacks against civilians; and to refrain from the indiscriminate use of weapons on the populated areas, in the manner that includes the indiscriminate bombardment and dropping explosive barrels on civilians, as well as the immediate stoppage of coercive indiscriminate detention, torture and kidnapping, as well as the immediate release of all detainees",1
"4
We emphasize the implementation of the UN Security Council resolution 2165 for the year 2014 that allows all parties in the Syrian conflict to convey the humanitarian aid immediately and without any obstacles, so as to deliver such aid directly to the people
5",1
"We reject overlooking and being silent about the terrorist groups that the Assad regime summoned to Syria and embraced, while they actually exercise genocide and forced displacements of population as well as introducing demographic change in Syria; such groups include the sectarian militias, the Iranian Republican Guards and the Lebanese Hezbollah
We call for listing these groups on the Terrorism Lists
6",1
"Respecting the will of the Syrian people; as the Syrians are the sole beholders of the power for founding the Constitution of the future Syria and approving each of its articles
This means that there should be no prior principles imposed on the people as a way for confiscating their free will
7",1
"We call for excluding Iran from any consultations concerning the Syrian cause, as Iran is truly red-handed with the blood of the Syrians, being a supporter of the terrorist militias, as well as acting to ignite sectarian strife among the Syrian people, in addition to the fact that Iran does not recognize the Geneva Communiqu as a reference (though this Communiqu has been fully supported by the UN Security Council resolution 2118)
8
We emphasize the continuity of the service-providing State institutions as a necessary and vital issue",1
"And yet, we reject the continuity of the works of the army and security institutions
We call for dissolving the security apparatus and restructuring the army and the judiciary
9",1
"The UN Security Council stated that it is calling for holding political negotiations and achieving political transition on the basis of Geneva Communiqu
The establishment of a transitional governing body has been very clear and explicit in the Communiqu
And thus, we call the UN Envoy to engage directly into the implementation of the Geneva Communiqu in a manner that is surrounded with regional and international guarantees; all without reverting to any preempted measures or committees formed that would consume time and lead to the rendering of the Geneva Communiqu void of content",1
"10
We emphasize the necessity of having real guarantees that obligate to all parties to implement whatever is agreed upon; as the Syrian regime has been accustomed to non-commitment to all resolutions throughout the past five years
11",1
"The explicit grave Russian intervention on Syrian territory is undermining the efforts exerted to reach a political solution
12
We call upon the UN and the UN Security Council to bear their responsibilities towards the Syrian tragedy, and to act seriously towards the implementation of the relevant resolutions in a manner that serves the interests of the Syrian people",1
"Then on 18 September 2015, a document was released titled The Five Principles of the Syrian Revolution and decorated with the j?hil? flag of Sykes-Picot
In it, they said: This is a declaration to the great Syrian people and the freemen of the world everywhere
As-Sal?mu alaykum wa rahmatull?h wa barakatuh",1
"The Syrian revolution was launched against tyranny, corruption, and oppression, and to achieve justice, transparency, and the recovery of ravished honor and freedom
The revolution resisted what the regime confronted it with including various kinds of repression and offence
The Syrian people, the launchers of this revolution, are not able to compromise their human and national rights guaranteed to them by Islam and all the heavenly religions and the international laws and systems",1
"They will carry on upon their path, holding on to all of its goals, through all legit means
Amongst these means is a political solution in accordance with the following fixed principles: 1) Eliminating Bashar al-Asad and all the pillars of his regime and to bring them before a just trial
2) Dismantling the tyrannical intelligence and military apparatuses and building security and military apparatuses based upon honest national roots while preserving the other state institutions",1
"3) The expulsion of all the foreign and sectarian terrorist forces from Syria, represented by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, Hezbollah, Abul-Fadl al-Abb?s militia, and the Islamic State organization
5 4) Preserving the unity of Syria as a country and people and preserving its independence, sovereignty, and its peoples identity
5) Rejection of any distribution of power based on political agendas and sectarianism",1
"Any method followed in negotiations for a political solution while not taking into account the dreams of the Syrian people is an attempt to bypass their goals
Accordingly, it is considered a waste of time
Similarly, any attempt to solve the important issues such as reconstruction, combatting terrorism, achieving domestic security and peace, and establishing a constitutional system, while not proceeding from the fixed principles of our great people will not be accepted by the Syrians, because doing so only dwarfs their cause and examines the symptoms while ignoring the root of the problem",1
"Although, we consider that every effort provided to save Syria to be an appreciated effort, we believe that delaying the decision on the major issue  which is the departure of al-Asad and his militias, the establishment of a united, independent, national, Syrian state  without guaranteeing any serious promises in this regards, will only increase the complexity of the problem and the depths of the wounds
The Security Council  which is responsible legally, politically, and morally to preserve world peace  has failed to defend the Syrian people, contribute in achieving their noble goals, and prevent the occurrence of massacres carried out against them
This is while we see attempts to rehabilitate the regime, even serious endeavors to make it a part of the present and future of Syria",1
"We also see the Security Council ignoring the terrifying massacres that occurred and continue to occur before and after the presidential statement
The national forces who signed this document reaffirm their adherence to the fixed principles of the Syrian people in their glorious revolution and consider that any transgression against these principles to be negligence towards the rights of the Syrians, disdain of their blood and sacrifice, and an effort that will never succeed, because it assumes and enforces a foundation that is rejected legally, politically, and morally
This was followed by a third document released on 3 October 2015",1
"In it, they say: Political offices of the undersigned rebel factions and the Syrian Coalitions political committee held a meeting and thoroughly studied the proposals put forward by the UN envoy Staffan de Mistura, namely the Working groups initiative
After in-depth reviewing of the regional and international reality engulfing the Syrian arena as well as recent sensitive developments with profound field and political influence, and out of our concern for the possibility of launching a new failed political process costing Syrians even more thousands of lives, and more destruction to the remnants of the countrys infrastructure, we affirm the following points: First: Participants in the meeting emphasize their commitment to reaching a political solution to achieve the goals of the revolution, preserve the identity of the Syrian people and end their suffering
This political process however must ensure that the current regime is not reproduced or that its head and pillars, whose hands are stained with the blood of Syrians, are not given any role in the transitional political process or in Syrias future",1
"Second: While forces of the revolution and the opposition have always dealt fully positive with the UN envoy despite the absence of any practical results on the ground, they emphasize they will continue to positively deal with the United Nations in order to achieve the interests of the Syrian people
Third: The Syrian people have completely lost confidence in the ability of the international community to support their cause after five years of regime crimes committed against them with Iranian military support, Russian political coverage and a legitimacy that the international community still insists on providing to the murderous regime
The current popular outrage must be taken into account in any political process which must be preceded by real steps to win the confidence of the Syrian people",1
"The most important of these steps is to explicitly declare that the head of the regime and its pillars cannot be given any role to play in the political process
Fourth: Bashar al-Assad has no place in any political process depending on the following legal and practical reasons: Bashar al-Assad inherited power in an entirely illegal way
Bashar al-Assad became a war criminal the moment he began killing Syrians who peacefully demanded their rights",1
"He used illegal chemical weapons against innocent civilians
These crimes have been documented by neutral international organizations to prevent any doubt in the matter
Bashar al-Assad and his regime have shown utmost reluctance to engage in any political process, have not abided by any declared truces, and have shown non-cooperation with the international community purely with humanitarian issues",1
"All of this has left him with no credibility or confidence
While Bashar al-Assad and his regime have failed in their alleged war against ISIS or to achieve any intellectual or field victory against this extremist organization, there is compelling evidence on full coordination between the two sides and the role Assads regime plays in the emergence of ISIS
6 Bashar al-Assad has opened the doors of Syria to foreign militias who commit the worst sectarian massacres at the same time as fuelling sectarian rhetoric, which deprives him of any eligibility to participate in any political process that aims to unite the country",1
"Finally, Bashar al-Assad has handed over Syria to Iranian and Russian invaders, thus committing an unforgivable act of betrayal to the countrys history, its future and dignity
Fifth: We consider that dissolving the security agencies and the restructuring of the military institution directly responsible for killing Syrians an essential item for any political solution
This beleaguered and crumbling military institution has turned into sectarian militias led by Iran",1
"It cannot therefore form the nucleus of a national army, nor can it be trusted by the Syrian people to restore security and stability to the country
Sixth: The formation of a transitional governing body is a process of full transfer of power in which Bashar al-Assad and pillars of his regime have no place
We emphasize the need to preserve state institutions and prevent their disintegration as they belong to the Syrian people, and to prevent the country from sliding into more chaos",1
"Seventh: We consider that proposing the Working groups initiative ignores the majority of the relevant United Nations resolutions on Syria, particularly resolutions 2118, 2165 and 2139
This initiative is in fact a complicated political process that requires confidence-building between the Syrian people on the one hand and the party that will sponsor the political process, namely the United Nations
Confidence-building can only be achieved through the implementation of the above-mentioned UN resolutions that the Syrian regime has so far disabled them",1
"Eighth: We consider that the Working groups initiative in its current form and its unclear mechanisms provides the perfect environment to reproduce the regime
These Working groups must instead be based on clear principles regarding standards for selecting the participants in these groups and the final vision for the solution
Ninth: We condemn Russias direct military escalation in Syria and consider the Syrian regime fully responsible as it has turned Syria into a hotbed for foreign intervention",1
"The silence of the international community also bears responsibility for this escalation and represents a point of no return in the relationship between the Syrian people and Russia
This escalation clearly shows that Russia is not serious or sincere in its commitment to the political process, and that it has never been a honest mediator but a party to the conflict and a key ally of the criminal regime
Tenth: While forces of the revolution and its institutions reaffirm commitment to our people, we vow to exert the utmost efforts to close ranks and correct previous mistakes",1
"We also vow that the revolution will remain faithful to its principles and the blood of its fallen heroes, and that we will strike a balance between achieving our objectives and safeguarding our fundamental principles
We also pledge to alleviate the suffering of our people, expedite victory and to dedicate our political and military capabilities for this purpose
Accordingly, the Working groups initiative in its current form is unacceptable neither practically nor legally unless the above-mentioned points are taken into consideration and the ambiguities shaping the mechanisms of this initiative are resolved",1
"Our recent withdrawal from Jaysh al-Fath has a number of reasons
A) Some of the factions in Jaysh al-Fath support missions contradicting the Islamic Shar?ah
This is clear in the last De Mistura statement released in which the sixth clause dictates: Respecting the will of the Syrian people; as the Syrians are the sole beholders of the power for founding the Constitution of the future Syria and approving each of its articles",1
"This means that there should be no prior princi ples imposed on the people as a way for confiscating their free will! There were other clauses in the document that we consider to oppose the Shar?ah including the welcoming of Turkish intervention and other defeatist statements
Therefore, Shaykh Ab? Muhammad al-Adn?n? said, As for you, O factions of apostasy and treachery, O factions of disgrace everywhere, O scum
Is it not time you learn a lesson from your predecessors from amongst the factions all the long years in Iraq? Did you not benefit from the lessons you were taught in Sh?m?  By Allahs permission, we are coming to you (O soldiers of the factions)",1
"And by Allah, we hold you as pitiful
So take these words from us and understand them
We know that your intentions, goals, and conditions are various",1
"Some of you fight us because of our religion, as you dont want an Islamic state, out of dislike for the law of Allah, in support of the taw?gh?t, and while being content with manmade laws
These are a small selection of you
Many of you fight us despite claiming to want implementation of the law of Allah",1
"But they have deviated and not found the correct path
Some of you fight us thinking we are a barbaric enemy against the Muslims
Others fight for the sake of the Duny? or a salary from the factions",1
"Others fight out of pride and bravery
And others have other various forms of intentions and evil
But know that we do not differentiate between these intents and goals and that our ruling upon you after overpowering you is one: a bullet splitting the head or a sharp knife inside the neck",1
"Shaykh Ab? Muhammad al-Adn?n? advised the Sahwah soldiers, By Allahs permission, O soldiers of the factions, we are coming to wherever you might be even if after some time
We did not come initially for you, so do not stand in the face of the muj?hid?n
Whoever throws his weapons aside and repents is safe",1
"Whoever sits in the masjid and repents is safe
Whoever enters his home, closes his door, and repents, is safe
Whoever from the factions and brigades abandons the war against us and repents is safe",1
"They are safe concerning their lives and wealth despite the severity of their former enmity towards the muj?hid?n and despite the amount of transgression theyd committed before
O Allah, we have conveyed, so witness [Say to Those Who Disbelieve, You Will Be Overcome]
The Islamic State is b?qiyah (remaining)",1
"It is b?qiyah because it was built from the corpses of the shuhad? and it was watered with their blood, and by this the market of Jannah was convened
It is b?qiyah because the success granted by Allah in this jih?d is clearer than the sun in the middle of the sky
It is b?qiyah because it was not soiled by har?m income nor a distorted methodology",1
"It is b?qiyah by the truthfulness of the leaders who sacrificed their blood and the truthfulness of the soldiers who raised it with their forearms; we consider them such, and Allah is their judge
It is b?qiyah because it united the muj?hid?n and is the refuge of the oppressed
It is b?qiyah because Islam has begun to rise and climb, the dark cloud has begun to scatter, and kufr has begun to be defeated and exposed",1
"It is b?qiyah because it is the supplication of the oppressed, the tear of the bereaved, the cry of the prisoner, and the hope of the orphan
It is b?qiyah because kufr in all its religions and sects gathered against it and because every treacherous and cowardly person of desire and heresy began to slander and defame it; so we became certain of the truthfulness of the goal and correctness of the path
It is b?qiyah because we are upon certainty that Allah will not break the hearts of the oppressed muwahhid?n and He will not let the oppressive people rejoice over such a defeat",1
"It is b?qiyah because Allah c promised in His explicit revelation by saying, {Allah has promised those who have believed among you and done righteous deeds that He will surely grant them succession to authority upon the Earth just as He granted it to those before them and that He will surely establish for them therein their religion which He has preferred for them and that He will surely substitute for them, after their fear, security} [AnN?r: 55]
{And Allah is predominant over His affair, but most of the people do not know} [Y?suf: 21]
""The Islamic State is baqiyah (remaining",1
"It is baqiyah because it was built from the corpses of the shuhada and it was watered with their blood, and by this market of Jannah was convened

Shaykh Ab? Muhammad al-Adn?n? (hafidhahull?h)  the official spokesperson of the Islamic State  said, O muwahhid?n in Europe, America, Australia, and Canada O muwahhid?n in Morocco and Algeria O muwahhid?n in Khur?s?n and al-Qawq?z O muwahhid?n everywhere upon the face of the earth O brothers in creed O people of wal? and bar? O patrons of the Islamic State O you who have given bayah to the Khal?fah Ibr?h?m everywhere O you who have loved the Islamic State O you who support the Khil?fah O you who consider yourselves from amongst its soldiers and patrons Your state is facing a new campaign by the crusaders",1
"So O muwahhid, wherever you may be, what are you going to do to support your brothers? What do you wait for while the people have become two encampments and the heat of the war increases day by day? O muwahhid, we call you up to defend the Islamic State
Dozens of nations have gathered against it
They began their war against us at all levels",1
"So rise O muwahhid
Rise and defend your state from your place wherever you may be He also said, O muwahhid, do not let this battle pass you by wherever you may be
You must strike the soldiers, patrons, and troops of the taw?gh?t",1
"Strike their police, security, and intelligence members, as well as their treacherous agents
Ruin their sleep
Embitter their lives for them and busy them with themselves",1
"If you can kill a k?fir American or European  especially the spiteful and filthy French  or an Australian, or a Canadian, or any other k?fir from the harb? kuff?r, including the citizens of the countries that entered into a coalition against the Islamic State, then rely upon Allah, and kill them in any manner possible, regard less of the method [Indeed Your Lord is Ever-Watchful]
They trick the people and say, A project for the Ummah
1 They then interpret this whenever they need as a project for Syria alone, encompassing only its land and revolutionaries  This playing on words is an attempt to beautify the proposals of the kuff?r and apostates",1
"The samm??n [the avid listeners to the kuff?r] do this so as to offer the kuff?rs proposals through themselves as Islamic proposals
They beautify the proposals and offer them as if the proposals were their own, when the reality is they are nothing but the messengers of the apostates, and in the best case, they are parrots repeating the proposals of the hypocrites and apostates who use these samm??n as a part of the war against Islam  The projects of kufr would never penetrate us except through the samm??n, not through the ranks of apostate secularists, the atheist liberals, and their parties I will mention some of their traits in this era  but it isnt necessarily the case that every faction of them has all these traits: 1) They beautify and propagate the principles of the kuff?r including nationalism, human rights, and minority rights
2) They flatter the apostate groups and claim that the muj?hid?n oppress them",1
"3) They ask that the muj?hid?n and apostates refer to them for arbitration, as if the two sides are equal
4) They announce their acceptance of the kuff?r as leaders for the lands
They cooperate with them, welcome them, and follow their orders",1
"5) They safeguard and sanctify the borders that the crusaders and descendants of pigs fabricated
6) They implicitly and explicitly slander the muj?hid?n
They ally with every debased person and apostate party, granting them refuge out of fear that the hands of the muj?hid?n might reach them",1
"7) They accuse the peo-ple of ?m?n with extremism and lack of goodness
They give verdicts that it is prohibited to perform jih?d with the muj?hid?n
8) They describe the conceding defeatists as moderates",1
"9) They declare their loyalty to international law
10) They ally with the enemies of jih?d and those who obtain financial aid from the people of kufr and aggression
11) They seek the support and aid of the kuff?r and apostates",1
"12) They turn a blind eye towards the crimes of the apostates and the kuff?r, whereas they dig for the mistakes of the good muj?hid?n
13) They have blind eyes, deaf ears, and mute tongues towards the k?fir and apostate enemies, whereas they have sharp tongues against the people of ?m?n and jih?d
14) They throw bad labels at the muj?hid?n",1
"They call them the other face of the Khaw?rij state and a party of deviance and terror, whereas they are more worthy of the description of deviance and farther from the truth and truthfulness
15) They declare their bar?ah from Salaf? Jihadism
16) They describe the muj?hid?n as Khaw?rij, extremists, and corrupters",1
"They wag their tails in front of the apostates
17) They call the taw?gh?t wul?t um?r [the people of authority]
But this is a lie, misguidance, and falsehood",1
"18) They prohibit that jih?d spreads to all the Muslims and interpret the Ummah to be Syria alone, the Syrian land, the Syrian country! 19) If a k?fir or t?gh?t dies, they rush to offer condolences and shed tears over him
They support them in their wars that are not jih?d for Allahs sake
20) They call the muj?hid?n takf?riyy?n because the muj?hid?n pronounce takf?r upon the crusaders, the Jews, the zan?diqah, and the apostates",1
"21) They welcome cooperation with the k?fir and apostate states
22) They follow and call for strict regionalism, as if they hold Sykes-Picot to be holy
23) They call for a state of justice, law, and freedom, because they are embarrassed of Islam",1
"2 24) They strive to guarantee safety for all the sects of kufr, apostasy, and heresy, so that these sects and the head of kufr [America] approves of these factions
25) They announce their respect of human rights pacts
26) They are embarrassed of the word jih?d, replacing it with revolution, revolutionary, and revolutionary action",1
"27) They promise not to own or attempt to obtain weapons of mass destruction, so as to calm Israel
28) They announce that their operations are restricted to the Syrian lands, to calm the Jews
29) They ask America to use them while not fearing that Allah will replace them  These are some of their traits",1
"And the matter is more disastrous and the calamity is even more widespread They attempt to seduce the muj?hid?n into accepting stipulations formulated in Ibl?ss lodge
Ibl?s then applied the appropriate makeup and gave the stipulations to the samm??n so that they could promote them
From amongst the demands they made in accordance with the desires of Shayt?n and his proxies were:  that operations are executed by Syrians alone and that the muh?jir?n are banished",1
"They also refused to denounce the pacts they formerly released, doing so in service of Shayt?n and his proxies
Let us discuss these demands from a number of angles
Who is the real demander of these stipulations? Is the demand from the samm??n or from the intelligence apparatuses of the apostate regimes behind these samm??n, the apparatuses these samm??n deal with? From the pacts that these samm??n announced before  a pact they recently declared their continued commitment to and refusal to renounce  was a pact published due to instructions from Turkey and Qatar, resulting from Western requests",1
"The samm??n themselves admitted this in the presence of numerous leaders of the muj?hid?n, my poor self being amongst them
It becomes clear that the declarations and demands of the samm??n are nothing but an execution of the demands of the apostate states, who have behind them the centers of kufr and international masonry
So the demands of the samm??n are nothing but a demand from the apostates and the execution of the demand is done in obedience to the apostates, in line with their ranks",1
"Can this be accepted by someone whose heart was touched by ?m?n or who tasted obedience to Allah? And are these demands in accordance with the Shar?ah or in opposition to it? 1) There is no doubt they oppose it rom a number of angles  Unity of ranks is not viewed by them except through the eyesight of a chicken
They look to Syria as being the whole world  They then unify with the people of the American Military Operation Cooperation room, the followers of America, the soldiers of Ibl?s, and everyone upon whom the devils descend
2) Accepting the stipulations of the samm??n also means approving or even partaking in their relationships and their receiving of instructions from the apostate states, and this is a man?t3",1
"3) Accepting the stipulations of the samm??n also means approving of their seeking help from the kuff?r, and this is not permissible according to the Shar?ah
4) Accepting the stipulations of the samm??n also means approving of their restricting of jih?d to the Syrian lands, a becalming message to the Jews
This is not permissible according to the Shar?ah, and is a form of foul regionalism",1
"5) Accepting the stipulations of the samm??n also means approving of their safeguarding of apostate and heretical sects, and this is a man?t
6) The rest of the disasters found in their pacts including the struggle to establish a state of justice, freedom, and law, and other deviances, are not hidden from anyone with a mind even if he is a layman in Shar?ah
He then describes them as an ally whose decision is in the hands of apostate regimes and who are allied to the apostate regimes and groups",1
"They blatantly call to what is demanded from them by the kuff?r and apostates
This party with these traits leads the Jabhah [Jawl?n? front] towards the camp of treachery
If the Jabhah refuses to partake in the treachery of the samm??n, it will not be able to go back to square one, thereby bringing about its own end He continues saying, Maybe some of the tricksters and circus performers of the Jabhah think that their abilities are very great and that they are able to trick the samm??n and tolerate them",1
"But I say that this idea is very similar to that of the Ikhw?n who want to trick America, for the samm??n are not the player in front of the Jabhah, rather the samm??n are a bride on the stage of brides who are moved by strings in the hand of America, the head of the axis of evil, representing the Zionist-crusader coalition and those who follow its caravan from the apostate regimes, the Mossad, and all the forces of kufr who have declared war against Islam
I know that the opinion of the tricksters is not like this and that they continue to assume the best in the samm??n
Im very sorry to say that these people are very, very few",1
"Alhamdulill?h
They are in a distant delusion, straying in the passes of falsehood and crypts of deviance
The samm??n announced and continue to announce that they will never abandon the support coming to them from the apostate states",1
"So when the Jabhah unites with them in a single body, what applies to them applies to it, including the seeking of help from the kuff?r and the submission to their conditions
This contradicts the teachings of the religion To be brief, the samm??n are like a girl who lost her virginity by having har?m relationships with the apostate regimes behind her
She was irritated by every woman who preserved her honor, chastity, principles, and religion, and instead of repenting to Allah, she wants to entangle every chaste women so that they are like her in vileness",1
"Allah (ta?l?) said, {They wish you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would be alike
So do not take from among them allies until they perform hijrah for the cause of Allah} [An-Nis?: 89] Some of those with heartburn ask where the jih?d scene is headed and they expect a military conflict with the samm??n  I say, yes, the condition is dangerous
The condition in the arena is dangerous  As for the issue of a conflict with the samm??n, then I ask Allah that it doesnt reach that, and that He prepares for the samm??n one who will return them to the truth",1
"Nevertheless, the matter is severe What is the difference between the group of samm??n and between Hazm and Jam?l Mar?f? Keep in mind that they gave refuge to the groups of Hazm and Mar?f after our conflicts with them
What is the difference between the group of samm??n and between Zink? and Zahr?n All?sh? Keep in mind that the samm??n are linked to All?sh through a coalition and strive to form a coalition with Zink? and its likes! All of them collect money from the outside
All of them follow agendas from the outside",1
"And when the samm??n ally with people like these, it indicates that there is no difference between them
And when the samm??n denounce the actions of the Jabhah against Jam?l Mar?f and Hazm, this means they are in the other camp
And when they take arms from Mar?fs group, claim that there is a se cret bayah from Mar?fs group to them, and protect them from the Jabhah, this means they are in the other camp",1
"Hazm, Jam?l Mar?f, the samm??n, Zink?, and their likes are connected to foreign agendas
They all receive aid from the governments of apostasy and kufr
The samm??n gave refuge to Mar?f and Hazm and protected them from us",1
"All of them execute what is dictated to them
But the master of all of them has not asked from the samm??n what he asked from Hazm and Mar?f
Their like is that of the scholars of the t?gh?t  What the t?gh?t of Syria and t?gh?t of Egypt demanded from their muftis, the Saudi t?gh?t did not demand initially",1
"So the Saudi scholars appeared more acceptable
But when the Saudi t?gh?t demanded from its scholars the same as the other taw?gh?t, they executed what was required of them  Rather, they did so in a more harmful and dangerous way
This is the exact difference between the samm??n and between Hazm and Mar?f",1
"All the movements that collect money  throughout history and to this day and age  have submitted to their masters and executed their orders when demanded
They will remain slaves to those who pay them
4 He then ends his article with poetry in which he refers to the factions as the ambassadors of the Jews and crusader party who seduce the people of chastity and purity",1
"These ambassadors drive the missions of kufr to us while displaying love for the lands of Sh?m  They are just the messengers of the enemies and apparatuses of the forces of apostasy
Ab? Fir?s responded by writing an article titled The Bankrupt Ones
In it he said, He who read the response of my brother Ab? Abdill?h ash-Sh?m? gets the impression that Ab? Abdill?h read my article online and had not known about it before! The truth is that I showed the article to my brother Ab? Abdill?h ash-Sh?m? two months before publishing it",1
"It earned his praise  So why did he approve of it only to later censure it? Is it an independent opinion that he reached later, or pressure upon our brother Ab? Abdill?h ash-Sh?m?? Was he pressured so strongly? Allah knows best
After quoting these various leaders he says, My words on the samm??n were based on facts
Before you are a selection of these facts",1
"My words were not based on suspected outcomes

We can safely say that one who curses the Sah?bah of the Prophet ? has left the religion [As-Sunnah  Al-Khall?l]
He also said, The R?fidah are those who declare bar?ah from the Sah?bah of Muhammad ?, curse them, degrade them, and curse the leaders of the Sah?bah except for four: Al?, Amm?r, al-Miqd?d, and Salm?n",1
"The R?fidah have nothing to do with Islam at all [As-Sunnah]
Al-Bukh?r? ? said, It makes no difference to me whether I were to pray behind a Jahm? or R?fid? or behind a Jew or Christian
They are not to be greeted with sal?m",1
"Their ill are not to be paid a sick visit
They are not to be married
Their funerals are not to be attended",1
"The meat they slaughter is not to be eaten [Khalq Af?l al-Ib?d]
Ahmad Ibn Y?nus ? (died 227AH) said, If a Jew were to slaughter a sheep and a R?fid? were to slaughter one, I would eat from the sheep slaughtered by the Jew and not eat from the one slaughtered by the R?fid?, because the R?fid? is a murtadd [As-S?rim al-Masl?l  Ibn Taymiyyah]
Ibn Hazm ? said, The R?fidah are not from the Muslims [Al-Fisal]",1
"Ibn Taymiyyah ? said, Whoever claims that some ?y?t of the Qur?n were deleted or hidden
then there is no difference of opinion on making takf?r of him
Also, whoever claims that the Sah?bah apostatized after Ras?lull?h ? except a very few who didnt exceed a dozen, or that they mostly became fuss?q (major sinners), then there is no doubt on making takf?r of him, because he has denied the praises of them that the Qur?n dictated in several places",1
"Rather, whoever doubts the kufr of such a person, then takf?r of him is obligatory
This is because the meaning of this statement is that the transmitters of the Qur?n and the Sunnah were kuff?r or fuss?q
It also means that those indicated by this verse {You are the best nation produced for mankind} [?l Imr?n: 110], whose best generation was the first, were mostly kuff?r or fuss?q",1
"It also means that this Ummah was the worst of nations and the predecessors of this Ummah were the most evil of its people! The kufr of such a person is known by necessity from the religion of Islam [As-S?rim al-Masl?l]
As-Sam?n? said, The Ummah has Ijm? on takf?r of the Im?miyyah because they believe the Sah?bah to be deviant and reject the Ijm? of the Sah?bah and attribute to them matters that are not befitting of them [Al-Ans?b] [Abridged from Hal At?ka Had?th ar-R?fidah 1]
Shaykh az-Zarq?w? ? also said, The im?ms of the Salaf pronounced takf?r upon the R?fidah and exposed their reality  Im?m M?lik ? said, He who curses the Sah?bah of Ras?lull?h ? has no share of Islam [As-Sunnah  AlKhall?l]",1
"M?lik also commented on the following verse: {And the description of them [the Sah?bah] in the Inj?l is as a plant which produces its offshoots and strengthens them so they grow firm and stand upon their stalks, delighting the sowers  so that Allah may enrage by them the kuff?r} [Al-Fath: 29] by saying, Thus whoever is enraged by the Sah?bah is a k?fir
Im?m ash-Sh?fi? followed him in this deduction [Il? Ummat? al-Gh?liyah]
He also said in his infamous letter censuring Shaykh azZarq?w? ?, If attacking some of the heads of the Sh?ah is necessary [as you claim], then why do you attack the laymen of the Sh?ah? Doesnt this lead to their false beliefs taking root deeper in their hearts, whereas the obligation upon us is to speak to them with dawah and clarify and convey the truth to them so that they might be guided to it? Will the muj?hid?n ever be able to kill all the Sh?ah of Iraq? Did any Islamic state in history ever try to do so? Why are the laymen of the Sh?ah killed despite them being excused due to their ignorance? And what would we have supposedly lost if we had not targeted the Sh?ah?  And do our brothers forget that both we and Iran are in need of each other not harming one another during this era in which the Americans target us both? He said in another letter censuring the targeting of R?- fid? temples, markets, and neighborhoods that he believes these deeds spill inviolable blood, as the blood of the women, children, and commoners of the Sh?ah  except their fighters  is inviolable, because they are excused due to ignorance",1
"He then goes on to say mockingly, Do you want to kill all the Sh?ah of Iraq? Then follow them up by killing all the Sh?ah of the Arabian Gulf and Peninsula? Then the Sh?ah of Iran, Sh?m, and the rest of the world?! He also said, [The muj?hid?n] must not fight the deviant sects such as the R?fidah, the Ism??liyyah, the Q?diy?niyyah, and the deviant Sufis, as long as these sects do not fight Ahlus-Sunnah
If they fight Ahlus-Sunnah, then the response should be limited to the fighters of these sects, while at the same time we must clarify that we are only defending ourselves
We must avoid striking their non-fighters, their families, their homes, their places of worship, their celebrations, and their religious gatherings  As for the areas that fall under the control and authority of the muj?hid?n, then these sects should be treated with wisdom after dawah, promoting awareness, exposing shubuh?t, and commanding the good and forbidding the evil in a manner that does not lead to a greater harm, such as the muj?hid?n being cast out of those regions or the masses revolting against them or a fitnah being instigated that the enemies of the muj?hid?n will exploit to occupy these regions [General Guidelines for Jih?d? Activism]",1
"The nationalist Taliban also defended the R?fid? state of Iran  both its government and public  saying, The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan denounces the new punishments by the Security Council against the Islamic Republic of Iran and the censures against this country and its people
The Emirate considers these decrees invalid
The Islamic Emirate, in accordance with its stance of sympathizing with nations, considers the last and previous economic threats from the Security Council to be a great transgression and oppression against the rights of Iran and its people",1
"In this regards, we say that the harmful effects and negative consequences of these warnings fall directly upon the public of Iran
So we demand that all matters be resolved and all problems settled through discussion and understanding [Statement from the Political Committee of the Emirate on Several Events regarding Afghanistan and the World]
During the gathering, it was also emphasized that the enemy at critical moments like this before his imminent withdrawal will extend his hand, in accordance with his despicable habit to exploit incidents like the sad day of ?sh?r?",1
"He strives to plant the seeds of hypocrisy and division between the united Afghan nation so as to break up their unity
This is because the enemy has failed in achieving all his schemes and conspiracies, so he wants to exploit this event as a bayonet by which he takes revenge against our oppressed and poor nation for all his defeats
But our alert and united nation will not lose patience",1
"It will not be reckless
It will never be fooled by the likes of these schemes done by the enemy
This scheme of theirs will fail like all the other schemes and conspiracies",1
"At the end of the gathering after discussing the two incidents from all the angles, the following statement was released containing the following points
1) The Islamic Emirate offers its condolences to the families of all the afflicted and aggrieved by these two incidents
It also severely condemns all the likes of these incidents",1
"2) The Islamic Emirate considers these incidents to be the deeds and schemes of the occupation and enemies of Afghanistan
It calls all citizens to fulfill their Islamic responsibility then their national responsibility and cooperate with each other to prevent any similar incidents, because, like this incident, the acts of the enemy are against all citizens and harm our motherly Afghanistan
3) The Islamic Emirate especially requests that all the scholars and prominent figures of the Sh?ah in Afghanistan be fully alert after what took place against them and teach their people the reality, which is that the matter is not at all that of enmity between Ahlus-Sunnah and the Sh?ah",1
"They should not pay attention to any irresponsible statements from some of the domestic agents of the enemy, those who give this incident the image of being sectarian and domestic spite
These agents do so to achieve their personal goals and satisfy their masters
4) The Islamic Emirate directs all its muj?hid?n to fulfill their responsibilities and carry out the tasks they have been assigned by focusing very much on preventing such atrocious acts from being repeated [Report on the Emergency Gather ing of the Leading Sh?r? Assembly of the Emirate and the Statement Released on the Two Attacks on ?sh?r? Day in Kabul and Mazar-i-Sharif]",1
"7
Shaykh Ab? Musab ? said in his famous letter to Shaykh Us?mah Ibn L?din ?, The R?fidah are the insurmountable obstacle, the lurking snake, the scorpion of deception and malice, the prowling enemy, the deadly poison
We here wage a war at two levels",1
"The first war is open and exposed with an aggressive enemy and clear kufr
The second war is a difficult and fierce one with a scheming enemy who dresses like a friend, shows approval, and calls to unity, while he conceals evil and plots day and night, after obtaining the heritage of all the B?tin? sects that had appeared throughout history, leaving a scar upon his face that the days cannot remove
The precise observer and wise scrutinizer realizes that Shiism is the immediate danger and real challenge",1
"{They are the enemy, so beware of them
May Allah destroy them; how are they deluded?} [Al-Mun?fiq?n: 4]
The message of history is confirmed by the testimony of current events, clearly informing the world that Shiism is a religion that does not agree with Islam except like how the Jews gather with the Christians under the label of People of the Book",1
"Shiism contains everything from blatant shirk, to grave worship, to circumambulating tombs, to takf?r of the Sah?- bah, to cursing the Mothers of the Believers and the best of this Ummah, to claiming distortion of the Qur?n  a logical result of their defamation of its carriers  in addition to the claim of the infallibility of the im?ms and that belief in them and recognition of their reception of revelation are a basis of faith as well as other forms of kufr and manifestations of zandaqah that their authoritative books and primary references overflow with
And they do not cease to print, distribute, and publish these books and references
The dreamers who think that the Shiite can forget his historical heritage and ancient black spite towards the Naw?sib  as the R?fidah label Ahlus-Sunnah  is mistaken",1
"He is like someone who demands the Christian abandon the idea of the Messiah being crucified [and still call himself a Christian]
Does an intelligent man do so? He then said, The R?fidah are a party of treachery and treason throughout history and the ages
It is a sect whose war is directed against Ahlus-Sunnah",1
"After this discussion, he stated, The R?fidah: They are the key to change
I mean they should be targeted and struck in their religious, political, and military core
This will provoke them to manifest their rancor against Ahlus-Sunnah and bare the teeth of the B?tin? spite festering in their chests",1
"If we succeed, it is possible to awaken the neglectful Sunnis, as they will feel the imminent danger and approaching death upon the hands of these Sabaiyyah [followers of Ibn Saba]
Ahlus-Sunnah, despite their weakness and division, are sharper blades and more resolved and truthful on the battlefield than these B?tiniyyah, for the R?fidah are a people of treachery and cowardice
They only assail the weak",1
"They only assault the helpless
Ahlus-Sunnah in general understand the danger of these people and are cautious and fearful of the results of such consolidation being granted to the R?fidah
If it were not for the cowardly dissuading heads of Sufism and the Ikhw?n, the people would have been much better off",1
"This matter, in addition to what is anticipated from it of awakening those who are in slumber, will also trim the nails of these R?fidah and pull out their canines before the inevitable war
It is also anticipated to incite the anger of the people against the Americans, who brought this destruction and who were the cause of this evil
It will also deter the people from enjoying leisure and achieving some of the delights they were prohibited before, which would make them succumb to comfort, cling to the earth, prefer safety, and turn them back from the clashing of swords and neighing of steeds",1
"The Method of Operation: Our condition dictates that we deal with the matter with courage and clarity and endeavor for a solution  The solution as we believe, and Allah knows best, is to expose the R?fidah and raise the resolve of Ahlus-Sunnah to fight them and stop them
This is for several reasons: A) The R?fidah have declared a hidden war against the Muslims
They are the close and dangerous enemy to Ahlus-Sunnah",1
"Even though the Americans are also a major enemy, but the R?fidah are more severely dangerous and more murderous towards the Ummah than the Americans  B) They took the Americans as allies, supported them, stood in their ranks in the face of the muj?hid?n, and sacrificed and continue to sacrifice for the Americans everything precious so as to end jih?d and the muj?hid?n
C) Our war against the R?fidah is a way to incite and raise the resolve of the Ummah for this battle
He ? also said elsewhere, It is not possible for the Muslims to achieve victory against the hostile kuff?r from the Jews and Christians except by abolishing those apostate agents  especially the R?fidah  near the Muslims",1
"This is what history observed for us, as Baytul-Maqdis, which fell in the hands of the Crusaders with the aid of the Ubayd? R?fidah, was not taken back except at the hands of Sal?hudd?n, despite N?rudd?n Mahm?d being harsher against the Crusaders than Sal?hudd?n
But Allah ? declared that victory and liberation of Baytul-Maqdis would be upon the hands of Sal?hudd?n
But when? After he fought the Ubayd? R?fidah for years and completely abolished and destroyed their state",1
"Thereafter, he dedicated his efforts to the war against the Crusaders until victory was achieved and he retook Baytul-Maqdis, which had been for years in the hands of the Crusaders due to the treachery of the R?fidah
This is a very important lesson that history presents to us
One should not be heedless of this lesson",1
"We will never have victory against the asl? kuff?r8 except after also fighting murtadd kuff?r in addition to the asl? kuff?r
The Islamic victories that took place during the era of al-Khulaf? arR?shid?n came only after cleansing the Arabian Peninsula of the apostates [Hal At?ka Had?th ar-R?fidah]
Therefore, Shaykh az-Zarq?w? ? said, By recalling historical experiences, testimonies of past eras, signs of current events, and the experiences we live today, we will understand truly the meaning of {They are the enemy, so beware of them",1
"May Allah destroy them; how are they deluded?} [Al-Mun?fiq?n: 4]
Throughout history, they have been a pang in the throats of the Muslims, a dagger in their backs, the rat that destroyed the dam, and the bridge over which the enemies of the Ummah pass
Shaykhul-Isl?m Ibn Taymiyyah spoke the truth when he described their condition after describing their takf?r of the Muslims, he ? said, For this reason, they help the kuff?r against the Muslim masses",1
"They also helped the Mongols
They were one of the biggest reasons for Genghis Khan, the king of the kuff?r, invading the Muslim lands
They were also the reason for Hulagu Khans invasion of Iraq, taking of Aleppo, and plundering of as-S?lihiyyah",1
"They also have many other treacheries they committed with their malice and deception
For this reason, they plundered the Muslim army as it travelled near them on its way back to Egypt after the first episode
For this reason, via armed robbery, they devastate the highways of the Muslims",1
"For this reason, they supported the Mongols and the Franks against the Muslims
The biggest sorrow was manifested by them when Islam again became victorious
Similarly, when the Muslims conquered the shores of Akkah and its nearby regions, the R?fidah supported the Christians and preferred them to the Muslims  All that I described is just a part of their evil, whereas the matter is much greater",1
"There is rancor and rage in their chests  the likes of which can be found in no other peoples hearts  directed to all ranks and levels of Muslims
According to them, the greatest act of worship is to curse the awliy? of Allah  The R?fidah are the people who strive the most to divide the Jam?ah of the Muslims
One of their greatest principles is to make takf?r of and curse the best of the Muslim leaders like al-Khul?f? ar-R?shid?n and the scholars, because everyone who does not believe in the infallible nonexistent im?m has not believed in Allah and His Messenger ?",1
"The R?fidah love the Mongols and their state, because through it they achieved honor the likes of which they could not achieve in a Muslim state
If the Muslims conquer the Christians and mushrik?n, it is a pang in the throats of the R?fidah
If the mushrik?n and Christians conquer the Muslims, it is a celebration and joy for the R?fidah [Majm? al-Fat?w?]",1
"That ends his words, rahimahull?h
It is as if he lives amongst us describing what he witnessed with his own eyes, when he says, And likewise, if the Jews establish a state in Iraq or elsewhere, the R?fidah would be from their greatest supporters, because they always support the kuff?r from the mushrik?n, the Jews, and the Christians
They help them in fighting and waging war against the Muslims [Majm? al-Fat?w?] [Il? Ummat? al-Gh?liyah]",1
"The spark has been lit here in Iraq, and its heat will continue to intensify  by Allahs permission  until it burns the crusader armies in D?biq
I will summarize what I have been guided to in the issue of creed and the issue of madhhab in the following points  Those many sects including the Sh?ahand other sects that say there is no god but Allah but leave the creed of Ahlus-Sunnah are still from the Ummah of Islam and the People of the Qiblah
Takf?r is not to be generalized upon them",1
"Their ascription to Islam and the Qiblah should not be negated except according to scales and limits defined by the scholars of Ahlus-Sunnah including the fulfillment of conditions and absence of impediments
This is the job of the expert scholars who have reached the degree of judging in creeds and faiths
This is not the job of individual Muslims including the ignorant and commoners amongst them",1
"This is also not the job of those who have dedicated themselves to jih?d and fighting off the invaders [Dawat al-Muq?wamah]
After falsely attributing his stance on the R?fidah to the scholars of Ahlus-Sunnah2 , he went on to claim it was also the stance of the so-called majority of jih?dists, saying, The Issue of the Sh?ah and Other Non-Sunn? Sects: The jih?dists consider all these sects to be within the Islamic Ummah or part of the People of the Qiblah  The Jafar? Im?m? Sh?ah: They are the majority of the Sh?ah in Iran
They are minorities in Lebanon, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the Mideast  The majority of the jih?dists consider them to be Muslims, from the People of the Qiblah, deviant, and mubtadiah [Dawat al-Muq?wamah]",1
"His deviance led him to declare the following in the alleged Jih?d? Creed and Constitution of the International Islamic Resistance Call, Article 10: The international Islamic resistance considers every Muslim who says there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is His messenger  regardless of their schools and denominations  to be within the general circle of Islam, which the scholars label the People of the Qiblah
It considers the theological, doctrinal, and denominational differences to be something for the scholars to judge
The solution for these matters is truthful discussion and clarification via wisdom and good admonishment  The resistance censures unrest and fighting amongst the Muslims",1
"It calls all the Muslims of the Qiblah as schools, groups, and individuals to cooperate in resisting the invaders and waging jih?d against the k?fir enemy who invades the Muslims lands
It calls everyone to abandon the calls to internal partisanship, which only benefit in these circumstances the k?fir enemy invading the Muslims lands [Dawat al-Muq?wamah]
His sentiment was echoed by adh-Dhaw?hir?, who said, Shaykh Hasan al-Bann?, may Allah have mercy upon him, was without a doubt a pioneering symbol of the Islamic movement",1
"Allah blessed him with martyrdom
We ask Allah to accept it from him and to accept from him the rest of his righteous deeds
Allah alone knows the extent of love and respect that I have for him in my heart  Shaykh Hasan al-Bann?, may Allah have mercy upon him, also planted the seed of jih?d in the modern Islamic movement [Al-His?d al-Murr]",1
"He also said, I dedicate the reward of this work tothe im?m, the reviver of the Islamic reawakening Hasan al-Bann?, who took the youth from the realm of recreation and play to the battlefields of jih?d [Shadh? al-Qaranful?t]
Or in the former words of the deviant liar Abu Qat?dah al-Filist?n?, who spoke the truth when he exposed Ikhw?n? ignorance of tawh?d and then said, Thus is any good expected of the Brotherhood party?! Can one expect from them any revival of what has collapsed of the great building of Islam?! What is even stranger are those who believe that the ideology of Hasan al-Bann? is the revivalist methodology for the Ummah in this era, while these people claim to be followers of the Salaf and Salafiyyah and raise the slogan of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jam?ah! What is even stranger are those who claim to have jih?d? methodology while believing that the difference between the Muslim Brotherhood party and the jih?d groups is like the difference between Sah?h al-Bukh?r? and Sah?h Muslim! For this reason, these people never abstain from uniting with the Ikhw?n, not against the apostates, but against the muwahhid?n  Rather, these people are used as a mount by the Ikhw?n? deviants to curse [the muwahhid?n] and call them takf?r? [Al-Jih?d wal-Ijtih?d]
Shaykh Ab? Muhammad al-Adn?n? (hafidhahull?h) said, The Ikhw?n are nothing but a secularist party with an Islamic cloak",1
"Rather, they are the wickedest of the secularists
They are a party that worships seats and parliaments
They allowed themselves to struggle and die for the sake of democracy, but would not allow themselves to wage jih?d and be killed for Allahs sake",1
"Indeed, their speaker boasted in an assembly of hundreds of thousands, saying, Be wary of turning back
Die for the sake of democracy
They are a party that would prostrate to Ibl?s without hesitation if it were required to achieve seats  The Ikhw?n partyabandoned all the principles of ?m?nwhen they agreed to attribute legislative right to others besides Allah c, when they shamelessly boasted, saying, Legislation is for the people",1
"They added thereafter, We are the representatives of the people in parliament
There is a clear contradiction in what they have said and done to the creed of the Prophets and the tawh?d of the Lord of the Heavens and the Earth  This kufr that the Ikhw?n party perpetrated and made other people fall into is the result of obeying the kuff?r of America and the West [As-Silmiyyah D?n Man]
He (hafidhahull?h) also said, There is no difference between Mubarak, Qaddafi, and Ben Ali, and Morsi, Mustafa Abdul Jalil, and Rashid al-Ghannushi, as they are all taw?gh?t who rule by the same manmade laws",1

"This was reiterated as a direct order from Amirul-Muminin, who said, O Muslims everywhere, whoever is capable of performing hijrah to the Islamic State, then let him do so, because hijrah to the land of Islam is obligatory
In this regards, the Caliphs spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani ? said, If the tawaghit have shut the door of hijrah in your faces, then open the door of jihad in theirs  If one of you wishes and strives to reach the lands of the Islamic State, then each of us wishes to be in your place to make examples of the Crusaders, day and night, scaring them and terrorizing them, until every neighbor fears his neighbor (That They Live by Proof)

"""O muwahhidin, rejoice, for by Allah, we will not rest from our jihad except beneath the olive trees of Rumiyah (Rome)
The memorandum on the ruling of those who refrain from making takfir of mushrikin who claim Islam begins by presenting two positions both being incorrect due to excess on one hand and negligence on the other, defining the term asl ad-din (the foundation of the religion) used in both as that by which tawhid is established before the advent of the prophetic proof
The first position presented was that whoever refrains from making takfir of mushrikin who claim Islam, is a mushrik exactly like them, because making takfir of them is part of asl ad-din",1
"So the refrainer is exactly like those who worship others besides Allah, and he is absolutely one of them in both name and ruling
The second position presented after was that takfir is not part of asl ad-din, but is one of its inferred requirements
So the one who refrains from making takfir of mushrikin who claim Islam, has not disbelieved until the hujjah (evidenced argument) is established against him, all shubuhat (doubts) are removed, and his tawil (misinterpretation) is eliminated",1
"The memorandum then explains that the first claim implies a corrupt concept, because major shirk has a reality and description that, if actualized, designates the one who possesses it a mushrik
If we were to absolutely equate the one who refrains from takfir with the one who worships others besides Allah, then making takfir of the one who refrains from making takfir of the refrainer would be absolutely necessitated, since major shirk is not excused by ignorance and the refrainer (according to the first claim) is a mushrik exactly like the initial person [the mushrik worshiping others besides Allah]
And the one who refrains thereafter [from making takfir of the other refrainers in the chain] is also a mushrik [exactly like the initial person], and so on",1
"This is the actual inference  not an imagined understanding  of this claims line of reasoning
This line of reasoning leads to making chain-takfir, an invalid bidah that can never be controlled and that originates from an incorrect understanding of the texts
This claim is rejected due to the invalidity of its inference",1
"The memorandum goes on to explain that the second claim also implies a corrupt concept, as it makes takfir of the mushrikin like one of the masail khafiyyah (obscure issues), for which it is impossible to establish the hujjah and impossible to make takfir of the refrainer as long as he has some shubhah (doubt) or tawil
The essence of this claim is the annulment of an agreed upon nullifier of Islam
Whereas, the existence of shubhah is a passing matter that must be eliminated As for making this passing matter a foundation upon which rulings are based, then this would result in the annulment of these rulings and the nullification of what it means to manifest the religion",1
"This is in opposition to what is transmitted from the imams of the religion, including the imams of the Najdi dawah ?
The memorandum then explains that it is wrong to use the terms asl (foundational basis) and lazim (required inference) with regards to the meaning of la ilaha illallah and kufr bit-taghut in an argumentative manner
That is because doing so is a fruitless, invented assertion with which Allah did not burden us",1
"Rather, multiple corrupt inferences necessarily result therefrom, like excluding certain matters established by the advent of the prophetic proof from being part of asl ad-din  in accordance with this definition  and thus excluding belief in the prophethood of Muhammad ? from asl ad-din! Likewise, it leads to disputation  regarding what is included in the meaning of asl ad-din and what is excluded from it
The memorandum then quotes Shaykh Sulayman Ibn Abdillah Ibn Muhammad Ibn Abdil-Wahhab ?, who was asked about a similar issue, regarding wala and bara, if such were from the meaning of la ilaha illallah or from its inferred requirements? Shaykh Sulayman ? responded, The answer is to say that Allah knows best
But it is sufficient for a Muslim to know that Allah made it a duty upon him to take the mushrikin as enemies and to not take them as awliya, and He made it obligatory to love the believers and to take them as awliya",1
"He made this an essential of iman, just as He negated the iman of whoever shows love to those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, even if they were their fathers, sons, brothers, or tribesmen
As for wala and bara being from the meaning of la ilaha illallah or from its inferred requirements, then Allah did not burden us with researching this
He only burdened us with knowing that Allah made wala and bara a duty and obligation and that He obligated acting on the basis of wala and bara",1
"This, undoubtedly, is what is obligatory and necessary
Thereafter, whoever knows whether wala and bara are from the meaning of la ilaha illallah or from its inferred requirements, then knowing such is fine and an added benefit
But whoever does not know such, is not burdened to know",1
"This is especially so if the argument or dispute over the matter leads to evil, conflict, and discord among the believers  those who upheld the obligations of iman, waged jihad for Allahs sake, took the mushrikin as enemies, and took the Muslims as awliya
Therefore, remaining silent on such matters that lead to division is definitely obligatory
This is what is apparent to me",1
"Nevertheless, the two sides are similar in meaning
And Allah knows best (Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah)
The memorandum then addresses another term, in addition to those mentioned before, stating that it is unacceptable to use the term takfir al-adhir (takfir of the excuser) to describe the ruling of the one who refrains from making takfir of mushrikin who claim Islam, because it is an inaccurate term",1
"While we reject ignorance as an excuse for major shirk, this innovated opinion (of excusing  for ignorance  those claimants of Islam who commit major shirk) does not necessitate that every excuser refrains from making takfir, as there are those of them who might consider ignorance an excuse, but who do indeed make takfir of the mushrikin because he considers the hujjah to have been established against them, so he is therefore not a refrainer
Likewise, refraining from making takfir of the mushrikin is not confined to the issue of excusing them due to their ignorance, as it is possible one might refrain from making takfir of them out of his arrogance, defiance, following of desires, or citing of general texts indicating the merits of la ilaha illallah
So the term takfir al-adhir does not accurately describe the one who refrains from making takfir of the mushrikin, such a refrainer being the one whom the scholars meant by this nullifier",1
"The memorandum continues, stating, The one who refrains from making takfir of mushrikin who claim Islam commits an agreed upon nullifier, but his kufr is based upon establishment of the proof, unlike the one who worships others besides Allah
Making takfir of the mushrikin is an issue established by apparent and numerous texts, which all people can understand
Establishing the argument thereof is by the Qurans advent, by either it being conveyed to the people or them having the ability to reach it",1
"Allah ? said, Say, What thing is greatest in witness? Say, Allah is a witness between me and you, and this Quran has been inspired unto me that by it I might warn you and whomever it reaches (Al-Anam 19)
The mujaddid Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Abdil-Wahhab ? said, Know that the evidences for making takfir of the otherwise righteous Muslim who commits shirk with Allah or sides with the mushrikin against the muwahaddin, even if he does not commit shirk, are more than one can compile from the speech of Allah,1 the words of His Messenger, and the statements of the scholars (Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah)
Shaykh Abdul-Latif Ibn Abdir-Rahman Ibn Hasan ? said, It should be known that the Book of Allah, the Sunnah of His Messenger, and the statements of the scholars are explicit, abundant, and manifest in making takfir of anyone who supplicates others besides Allah and calls upon them for something only Allah can do  The entire Quran demonstrates and confirms this in various manners and expressions that explain this and make note of it (Ad-Durar As-Saniyyah)",1
"Other scholars of the Najdi dawah said, The one who does not make takfir of the mushrikin has not accepted the teachings of the Quran to be true
The Quran has made takfir of the mushrikin and has ordered making takfir of them, taking them as enemies, and fighting against them (Ad-Durar As-Saniyyah)
However, this matter could become somewhat obscure with regards to some mushrikin who claim Islam, due to the spread of ignorance, the weakness of dawah, and the circulation of shubuhat",1
"Here, the proof is established by demonstrating the clear texts evidencing the kufr of these mushrikin
If someone refrains after this clarification, he becomes a kafir
Shaykh Sulayman Ibn Abdillah ? said, If someone doubts their kufr or is ignorant of it, the evidences proving their kufr from the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger ? are to be presented to him",1
"After this, if he doubts or hesitates, then he is a kafir according to the ijma of the scholars, since the one who doubts the kufr of a kafir is himself a kafir (Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah)
But if their matter becomes manifest by the religion mounting, its voice rising, and its dawah being conveyed then there is no consideration given to any shubhah that would suspend the legal ruling
This is what is known from the imams of guidance, like those of the Najdi dawah who faced this issue and died upon goodness",1
"Some of the imams of the dawah ? said, Whoever does not make takfir of the mushrikin of the Ottoman State and the grave worshipers like the people of Makkah and others who worship righteous people, who deviate from the tawhid of Allah to shirk, and who replace the Sunnah of His Messenger ? with heresies, then he is a kafir just like them, even if he hates their religion, despises them, and loves Islam and the Muslims
For the one who does not make takfir of the mushrikin has not accepted the teachings of the Quran to be true
The Quran has made takfir of the mushrikin and has ordered making takfir of them, taking them as enemies, and fighting against them (Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah)",1
"The memorandum stated, The Organization of alQaidah in Syria (Jabhat an-Nusrah) and those groups with it in the encampment of factions whom the Islamic State fights are parties forcefully resisting the implementation of Allahs Shariah, parties who have assisted the apostates aiming at establishing a democratic civil kufri state
They fight together in one trench against an Islamic state, which no one doubts rules by the Shariah, incite others to fight against it by all means, and strive to displace its authority from the land, thereby replacing the Shariah of Allah, which it upholds, with jahili rulings and man-made laws
All of this is done with the air cover of the Crusader campaign against the Islamic Khilafah",1
"These nawaqid (nullifiers of Islam) and others have been committed by all of the factions who claim Shariah and jihad but have remained in the camp of the apostates who fight the army of the Khilafah
These factions claiming Shariah and jihad did not withdraw from the apostate camp and declare their disassociation from them and their kufr, rather, they joined their alliances and supported them The Islamic State has manifested the ruling of the Shariah regarding these factions, leaving no room thereby for any doubters
The Islamic State manifested that these factions are apostate parties who have openly committed kufr and whose condition has become evident, in a way that establishes hujjah and severs any shubhah an ignorant person might have",1
"This includes what is found in the memorandum released by the Delegated Committee 2 As such, it will not be accepted that any of our troops is found refraining from making takfir of the individuals from the parties who fight us and whom we fight over Allahs Shariah
Any of the troops of the Islamic State who is found refraining from making takfir of these factions shall have his case referred to the amir of his division for the refrainer to be summoned and what was alleged against him be confirmed
The condition of these factions will be explained to him if he is ignorant thereof",1
"Then, if he refrains from making takfir of these factions after the clarification, he will be transferred to the court for istitabah [for the court to demand the soldiers repentance or otherwise  if he refuses to repent  for him to be punished for apostasy]
Let the invading aggressors and spiteful Rafidah know that the blood of Ahlus-Sunnah is dearly expensive, and it will never be wasted in vain after today

"As we state on page 49 in NATURE'S ETERNAL RELIGION, if we are for White Racial supremacy then we must stop giving them credit and respect which they did not earn, do not deserve, and never did
Again, it is very strange that the same people who are so affronted by the niggers not getting their ""proper respect"" are totally unconcerned about the vicious, unwarranted attacks by the niggers and other mud races upon the White Race and will not lift a finger in the defense of their own kind
They seem to deem it quite proper that the niggers should be loyal to their race, the Jews should be loyal to their race, but when the White Man is asked to show a loyalty to his own race, he is immediately denounced, even by members of his own race, as being a racist, a bigot, a Nazi, and many other derogatory smear words that the Jews have concocted",1
"Most victims of race crime - about 90 per cent - are White
Almost 1 million White Americans were murdered, robbed, assaulted or raped by black Americans in 1992, compared with about 132,000 blacks who were murdered, robbed, assaulted or raped by Whites
Blacks are committing more than 50 times the number of violent racial crimes of Whites",1
"WE BELIEVE that the Cananite Jew is the natural enemy of our Aryan (White) race
This is attested by scripture and all secular history
The Jew is like a destroying virus that attacks our racial body to destroyer Aryan culture and the purity of our Race",1
"Those of our Race who resist these attacks are called ""chosen and faithful"" John 8:44; 1Thessalonians 2:15; Revelations 17:14
The culture of a race, free of alien influences, is telling evidence of that race's essential nature
The African Negro with a cow-dung hairdo, a bone through his nose, and teeth filed down to sharp points, in other words, presents to us a far more accurate image of the Negro essence than does the American Black in a business suit who has been trained to drive an automobile, operate a typewriter, and speak flawless English",1
"Negro culture inferiority is the consequence of the physical inadequacy of the Negro brain in dealing with abstract concepts
On the other hand, the Negro shows an ability approaching that of the White at mental tasks requiring only memory
That is why the Negro can be trained relatively easily to adapt to many aspects of White culture",1
"It has been well known since the large-scale intelligence testing of U
S
Army recruits in World War I that the average Negro IQ is approximately 15 per cent below that of the average White",1

"Influential organizations and much of the western media promote a quasi-religious Anne Frank cult
She has become a kind of secular saint
Along with many other Belsen camp inmates, Anne came down with typhus, from which she died in mid-March 1945",1
"She was not killed or murdered
Anne Frank perished - like millions of others, both Jewish and non-Jewish, in Europe during that terrible time - an indirect victim of history's most devastating war
Few people realize that Anne, along with father and sister, and thousands of other Jews, ""survived"" Auschwitz-Birkenau",1
"Her father, Otto Frank, came down with typhus and was transferred to the camp infirmary there to recover
He was one of thousands of sick and feeble Jews who were left behind when the Germans abandoned the camp in January 1945, shortly before it was overrun by the Soviets
He died in Switzerland inAugust 1980",1
"If the German policy had been to kill Anne Frank and her father, they would not have survived Auschwitz-Birkenau
Their fate, as tragic as it was, cannot be reconciled with the Holocaust extermination story
[The Holocaust] along with Christianity, ranks as one of the biggest lies and biggest hoaxes in history",1
"Privately, among themselves, the Jews published the growth of their total world population between 1938 and 1948, as increasing from approximately 16,600,000 to 17,650,000, an increase of over a million
This would be an outrageous impossibility, if it had been decimated by 6,000,000 during this same period
It has reaped tremendous dividends for them",1
"Having worldwide monopoly of the propaganda machinery, they were able to put that lie across with little or no opposition
For many years, scholars and researchers have been delving into the history of World War II, and their research has cast a lot of doubt on the commonly accepted 6 million figure for Jewish losses in that war
Now undoubtedly you've heard Jewish spokesmen decrying this movement among historians and researchers to bring our history books into closer accord with the facts",1
"This movement is usually called ""revisionism,"" because of the belief of its adherents that the history of wars is usually written by the victors, and the victors often have a lot of reasons for lying: covering up their own atrocities, and justifying extreme actions taken against those they wish to paint as ""evil
"" But what these Jewish spokesmen haven't told you is that it isn't only Revisionists who have questioned the six million figure
Even establishment historians and even official Jewish ""Holocaust"" historians have been forced by new studies and documents to drastically revise that figure downward",1
"I just recently graduated high school in southern Oklahoma
I do not consider myself to be a racist, but I noticed that the black students at my school oppressed the white students
They hated the white kids that did not conform to their way",1
"I remember an incident where a friend of mine and another student were playing in the halls, like all kids do, and accidentally bumped into a black kid
I was there, and he did not do it on purpose
He tried to apologize to the black, but by that time a group of other black students were approaching",1
"All the blacks ganged up around my friend, so I stood in his defense
Then out of nowhere one of the black kids spit on me! Of course I then retaliated with a blow to the guy's face, then they all jumped in on me and I was out numbered 6 to 1! The teachers broke up the fight
We were all taken to the office",1
"I tried to explain what had happened to the principal, but he would not listen to my account and sentenced me and the 6 black kids to detention
I thought it to be unfair and a weak stand on his part! And my friend was too scared of them to stand up for me because they had threatened him
That is just one of many instances that I recall",1

He was a selfless man who gave his life in the resistance to Jewish/mud tyranny - a man who for whatever reason ultimately decided that violence was the way to strike back against the enemies of our people - enemies who had used violence against our people for
