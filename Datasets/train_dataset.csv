point in dishing out $30k a year just to get into college, only for most people to either 
drop out or get a useless degree, or something they're not entirely interested in.
 I don't think everything should be free, but there's one thing that absolutely must be- 
Education. Primary and Secondary school is free for students, which is excellent because 
every human deserves the chance and the right to be educated.
 Yet in college, most the time it's going into a huge room with a hundred other students, 
taking notes of what the professor says, and then studying your ass off to try to actually 
pass the class. A lot of times, the teachers aren't even good at teaching in the first place.
 Yet in Elementary ~ High, you have teachers working their ass off, helping each student at 
the rise of a hand.
 So normally school only costs tax payers. You get all the help you need for free, during 
class. You can fuck up all you want.
 College, you pay a FUCKLOAD of $$$ for, get shitty teachers, have to do everything 
yourself, and have a low chance of success.

While I am not advocating that we all run around blundering and goofing up all the timeï¿½and certainly none of us like dealing with people who make the same mistake over and overï¿½our fear of mistakes has a very high cost.

It seems like an irrelevant question to be concerned about. No one can obtain knowledge
about what happens after death, nor if anything is required to do for the deceased. If
some ritual was necessary, no one could know about it nor have any knowledge about
the requirements of it. Perhaps there's a magical platypus who requires that you burn a
wooden effigy of a hamster so that the deceased can ride it to the gates of Valhalla.
From observing other people who have died, the only conclusion which can be reached
is that nothing happens. Treating death as if it's the end of everything would be the most
prudent course of action because believing that something happens is contrary to the
observable world of the life which you are certain about having, thus deluding you into
behaving in a way which could negatively impact your life.",1

"The Career Craftsman knows thereï¿½s no magical ï¿½right jobï¿½ waiting out there for you. Any number of pursuits can provide the foundation for an engaging life. The Career Craftsman believes that compelling careers are not courageously pursued or serendipitously discovered, but are instead systematically crafted. The Career Craftsman believes this process of career crafting always begins with the mastery of something rare and valuable. The traits that define great work (autonomy, creativity, impact, recognition) are rare and valuable themselves, and you need something to offer in return. Put another way: no one owes you a fulfilling job; you have to earn it.",0

"Where details are known as to the inner workings of authoritarian regimes, wesee conspiratorial interactions among the political elite, not merely for preferment or favor within the regime, but as the primary planning methodologybehind maintaining or strengthening authoritarian power. Authoritarian regimes create forces which oppose them by pushing against apeopleï¿½s will to truth, love and self-realization. Plans which assist authoritarian rule, once discovered, induce further resistance. Hence such schemes are concealed by successful authoritarian powers until resistance is futile or outweighed by the efficiencies of naked power. This collaborative secrecy, working to the detriment of a population, is enough to define their behavior as conspiratorial. Thus it happens in matters of state; for knowing afar off (which it is only given a prudent man to do) the evils that are brewing, they are easily cured.

Amazon’s website, the motive of the very few people who oppose its removal is nothing other
harrowing. According to them, it’s inappropriate for Amazon to not support the free speech
of authors. These people use the same mentality and reasoning for the justification of the
availability of material pertaining to nuisances such as racial supremacy, as if pedophilia is
something that is equivalently morally repugnant; as if the existence of information pertaining
to it should merely be grudgingly tolerated rather than supported as something which can
be positive. I don’t have an moral opposition to a book which directs adults on how they can
safely have a relationship with children: I condone its availability. Information like that needs
to be available because any beauty which could potentially be present in such relationships
is currently violently suppressed. I support anyone, child or adult, who believe that their
love is important enough to be in a relationship together and risk the current consequences,
because I believe that nothing is more important than love. Those who seek the application
of violence to suppress these relationships are the depraved profligates, not the individuals
who seek to express their love regardless of age.",1

don't give a fuck about the new stigma of giving attention to killers, as it's going to happen

any decency from a bunch of scumbags who lack any form of empathy anyways. Mass 
murderers kill for fame.

"Are you a virgin?
You believe that a degenerate capitalistic system results in a commodification of sexuality.
This enables the creation of a cultural notion that premarital sexuality is acceptable. This
results in sexuality becoming widespread. This has three primary consequences:
The first is that there are some males who believe that the existence of this attitude of
sexuality is a justification of date rape, which causes instances of it to increase. The
second is that the existence of this attitude destroys the significance of marriages. Fewer
people get married, and of the people who do get married, more divorce. The third is that
the prevalence of sexuality results in more abortions, and more unwanted children, than
would otherwise result.
You believe that it would be desirable to outlaw premarital sex to cause a gradual cultural
shift away from all of this. And I would like you to briefly elaborate on something so that
I can better understand your position. What is it about marriage that appeals to you, and
why do you oppose the prevalence of divorces?",1

"Pre and post 9/11 the Maryland Procurement Office and others have funded mathematicians to look at terrorist conspiracies as connected graphs (no mathematical background is needed to follow this article). We extend this understanding of terrorist organizations and turn it on the likes of its paymasters; transforming it into a knife to dissect the conspiracies used to maintain authoritarian power structures. We will use connected graphs as a way to apply our spatial reasoning abilities to political relationships. These graphs are very easy to visualize. First take some nails (ï¿½conspiratorsï¿½) and hammer them into a board at random. Then take twine (ï¿½communicationï¿½) and loop it from nail to nail without breaking. Call the twine connecting two nails a link. Unbroken twine means it is possible to travel from any nail to any other nail via twine and intermediary nails. Mathematicians say that this type of graph is connected. Information flows from conspirator to conspirator. Not every conspirator trusts or knows every other conspirator even though all are connected. Some are on the fringe of the conspiracy, others are central and communicate with many conspirators and others still may know only two conspirators but be a bridge between important sections or groupings of the conspiracy.",0
