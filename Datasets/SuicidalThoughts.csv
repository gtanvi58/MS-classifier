"Ex Wife Threatening SuicideRecently I left my wife for good because she has cheated on me twice and lied to me so much that I have decided to refuse to go back to her. As of a few days ago, she began threatening suicide. I have tirelessly spent these paat few days talking her out of it and she keeps hesitating because she wants to believe I'll come back. I know a lot of people will threaten this in order to get their way, but what happens if she really does? What do I do and how am I supposed to handle her death on my hands? I still love my wife but I cannot deal with getting cheated on again and constantly feeling insecure. I'm worried today may be the day she does it and I hope so much it doesn't happen.",suicide

"Im so lostHello, my name is Adam (16) and Ive been struggling for years and Im afraid. Through these past years thoughts of suicide, fear, anxiety Im so close to my limit . Ive been quiet for so long and Im too scared to come out to my family about these feelings. About 3 years ago  losing my aunt triggered it all. Everyday feeling hopeless , lost, guilty, and remorseful over her and all the things Ive done in my life,but thoughts like these with the little Ive experienced in life? Only time Ive revealed these feelings to my family is when I broke down where they saw my cuts. Watching them get so worried over something I portrayed as an average day made me feel absolutely dreadful. They later found out I was an attempt survivor from attempt OD(overdose from pills) and attempt hanging. All that happened was a blackout from the pills and I never went through with the noose because Im still so afraid. During my first therapy I was diagnosed with severe depression, social anxiety, and a eating disorder.
I was later transferred to a fucken group therapy for some reason which made me feel more anxious. Eventually before my last session with a 1 on 1 therapy she showed me my results from a daily check up on my feelings(which was a 2 - step survey for me and my mom/dad )
Come to find out as Ive been putting feeling horrible and afraid/anxious everyday , my mom has been doing Ive been doing absolutely amazing with me described as happiest shes ever seen me, therapy has helped him 
I eventually was put on Sertaline (anti anxiety or anti depression Im sorry I forgot) but I never finished my first prescription nor ever found the right type of anti depressant because my mom thought I only wanted the drugs so she took me off my recommended pill schedule after ~3 week and stopped me from taking them. All this time Ive been feeling worse afraid of the damage/ worry Ive caused them even more. 
Now here with everything going on, Im as afraid as Ive ever been . Ive relapsed on cutting and have developed severe insomnia . Day after day feeling more hopeless, worthless questioning why am I still here? Whats my motivation to move out of bed and keep going? I ask these to myself nearly every night almost having a break down everytime. 
Please Please Please someone.. anyone help me.
Im so scared I might do something drastic, Ive been shaped by fear and anxiety. Idk what to do anymore",suicide
"Honetly idkI dont know what im even doing here. I just feel like there is nothing and nowhere for me. All i can feel is either nothing or unbearably sad. Im ignoring friends every opitunity i can. I feel like im loosing my girlfriend. I only hurt everyone i talk too and i dont cause anything good. Im behind on my education, i feel alone but for the first time its not a feeling ive enjoyed. I have no hopes or dreams. I care about nothing, not family, not friends, not even my girlfriend (i still love her, its complicated and i dont have the words to describe it). 

I would do something to end myself but i know im not strong and brave enough to do it, and knowing im that weak makes me sadder. The only thing i can do is push away all emotion and be empty, because as bad as it is im used to it, its my way of being normal. 

I dont understand how people have hopes or dreams, and i mentioned how bad i was feeling to my girlfriend but she just got scared i would die so i havnt brought it up again. But in that talk i realised i cant even comprehend my life having meaning to anyone.

I know this is just me rambling and i will probably regret posting this as ill think im taking the place of someone having a worse time with a gun to their head. I encoage all people who see this to help them instead of me. Ill probably suvive, they might not. Plus my life is meaningless and my future bleak, while they could cure cancer or something useful.

"[Trigger warning] Excuse for self inflicted burns*I do know the crisis line and used it after when I was having a panic attack.
*I know it's not a healthy thing to do.

But, I did. I did something stupid out of impulse. I burned myself.  I REALLY need help with an excuse as the father of my daughter knows my history (we were together 12 years.) He's seen my at my worst - but! I had always only cut on my ankles and wrists, I'm thinking the excuse for this would be easier than one for cuts.


 I did work on my car last night and I hadn't self harmed in a LONG time. I just did it without thinking, as usual; impulse and lost in the moment.


Should I say I touched something under the hood while the car was still hot? I have 3 almost in a curved like pattern the first on forearm then down a little then on the side of my wrist. They are about an inch long, kind of wide and a little deep. 

I think the car excuse  is a good one but I would need to say what I was working on to explain the 3 burns. Maybe that there was a wire smooshed behind the engine and when I went to fix it I touched the engine? 

I do not want to self harm again, I just need to be able to explain this.",suicide

2000's to the 90's and it doesn't really make me feel unique it's just my style but seeing as my friends and classmates getting more into rap and EDM it's hard for me to feel like I fit in.
The I don't feel like I stand out is because of all the others copying a style and if I do that I'd be just another
""Quirky kid"" who's in a cringey phase.
Many of my friends say that I look good in grunge style and I kinda agree but it's hard for me to continue that if I can't even stand out from all the ""edgy
People who wore crosses and wallet chains and do tiktoks""

Really feels like I don't fit in in all categories, am scared that people might confuse me with a CLOUT CHASER or a fucking tiktok e boy goddamn

"My life is over at 20 years oldHello all. I am a 20 year old balding male. My hairline is trash and to make matters worse my head is HUGE. I have bipolar, depression and crippling social anxiety. Balding has been the cherry on top. I wear a hat 24/7 even in my room when Im alone because I cant stop thinking about it. I pop Xanax all day to try and numb the pain and it works for a little bit but it all comes crashing back twice as hard once I come down. I dont know how to communicate with people anymore and I dont know how to keep a relationship. I used to be one of the popular kids but after my dad passed away I feel into a deep dark hole. Ive been arrested numerous times, been in rehab, mental hospitals, you name it. The only reason I havent killed myself yet is because of my mom and brothers. If I didnt have them Id be dead long ago. But its getting to the point where even their love and support isnt going to be enough to keep me alive anymore.

"Trapped inside a voidDear whoever cares enough to read this, though I doubt there are any that fall under that criteria.

I am trapped inside a void.  There is absolutely nothing for me.  I go through the monotonous tasks of every-day life with nothing to look forward to, no aspirations whatsoever.  The only saving grace I felt like I had, the only thing that made me feel like I was wanted, and accepted me for who I am, was Maren.  As absolutely idiotic as it sounds (and shes assured me that it is,) talking to her was the one thing I looked forward to every day.  It was the one thing that kept me going; knowing that some time throughout the day I would be able to talk to her, even if only briefly before we went to sleep.

She made me feel accepted.  She made me feel like I had some kind of worth.  She made me feel like I could actually like myself, and be okay with who I was.  But most of all, she made me feel loved.  Never before have I ever been able to open up to someone so completely.  I felt completely at ease when talking with her.  Ive told her things that no one else in the world knows about me, and she made me feel like she actually cared about them- that she cared about me.  We shared many intimate moments that I would never dare have with anyone else.  We talked about getting together, being with each other, devising crazy scenarios with how to be together.  We talked all the time, nothing could keep us apart.  Except for Ty.  She helped me through all of the problems I was facing related to my depression over the break-up with Starr.  She talked to me whenever I needed her, and she always made me feel better about it.  She was my shining star in a pitch-black sky.  None of this is any longer, though.

We have slowly drifted apart as she began to realise exactly how I am.  I am sure she regrets getting involved with me, and I dont blame her.  I do nothing but hurt her these days.  None of it is intentional, but it happens nonetheless.  When we first started talking again, I told her about my clingy tendencies and she said she was okay with that.  I suppose she thought I was over-exaggerating, but I wasnt.  I need to have interaction in my life.  I know it is not fair to the people around me, and I know that it is not what they want, but I cannot be alone in my own thoughts all the time.  My thoughts are extremely self-destructive.  I need someone to spend time with, someone to talk to to get away from my thoughts.  

For about four months I was legitimately happy.  That was probably the only time in my life I have ever actually been legitimately happy.  I was finally over Starr, thanks to the help from Maren.  I had no stress at all, things were actually looking up, even my migraines were becoming few and far between.  I was in love, and I felt loved.  If I could go back in time and re-play those four months over and over again, I would without hesitation.  That was the best time of my life.  I didnt have people ridiculing me for various reasons beyond my control.  I didnt have to feel like I had to hold all of my feelings inside.  I could share them with Maren, and she was incredibly receptive.  I didnt have to lie about who I was, or leave details out.  Maren made me feel like I was a good person.  I told her about my past, and she seemed genuinely concerned for me.  She tried hard to dispel all of the hateful things I have been told about myself.  She told me that I was attractive, something I had never been told before, not even by Starr, who I was together with for ten years.  I was happy with who I was at that time.  Prior to that I had never willingly taken a picture of myself.  But with her, we would send each other snapchat pictures, and she made me feel like I wasnt the hideous person that I thought myself to be.  In hindsight, I am sure that she was just being nice to me, and that she did not actually think I was attractive.  It was still nice to hear it, though.

I miss those days.  I long for them to return, but I know that that will never happen.  The same thing has happened with many people before, though none to that extreme.  They are fine with me when we first start talking, and eventually they realise how high-maintenance and fucked up I am.  That causes them to drift away, until eventually we stop talking altogether, or sometimes they just abruptly cut me out of their lives.  That was the case with Starr.  The night before she broke up with me she told me that she loved me.  In the morning, she told me it was over and a few weeks later told me to never talk to her again.  After ten years of being together, she ended it on a whim, and caused me to lose not only my significant other, but also my best friend.  The same thing is happening with Maren.  I am driving her away, and eventually I will not have a best friend again.  I will be completely alone.  The last time I was completely alone, right after Starr broke up with me, I didnt leave my room for two weeks.  I didnt eat a single thing in those two weeks.  I laid there in bed, staring at my ceiling in the darkness, constantly in tears, trying to realise where I had gone wrong.  I have never cried so much in my life.  I have hid my emotions from outside view all of my life, but at that moment I could not contain them any longer.  I had absolutely nothing left for me in the world, and that is how I feel again, right now.

It was complete luck that I was actually able to reconnect with Maren again.  I have no idea at all how to make friends.  She just happened to be online on Facebook when I was feeling at my absolute lowest.  I sent her a message with no expectations whatsoever, I was prepared to either be completely ignored, or told to go away.  That didnt happen though.  We had a wonderful conversation, reminiscing about our childhood.  I dont remember how the subject got changed to me talking about Starr, but I told her everything, and she seemed like she genuinely cared about it.  She stayed up with me until the morning, just talking with me on Facebook.  I was in tears for most of that conversation, partly because I was still upset about the breakup, but also because I couldnt believe that someone actually cared.  Especially someone I hadnt talked to in over a decade.  When we started to get close, and revealed our feelings for one another, we joked about how us reconnecting was a red string of fate.  I dont believe in fate, but I also dont think it was just dumb luck that caused us to reconnect at that moment, when I felt like I had nothing left.  The problem lies in the fact that I will never be able to replicate that with anyone else.  I am incredibly socially awkward; I cannot make new friends at all.  In person I just completely freeze up and get overwhelmed with anxiety.  Online, I just have nothing to say.  I am a boring person.  I have tried to make new friends on various subreddits, /r/r4r, /r/kikpals and the like.  I have talked to a few people who seemed nice, but none of them developed into an actual friendship.  They all stopped talking to me after one session.  I dont have anything at all to give in a friendship.

After fighting with Maren, and being told that I cant keep badgering her to hang out with me, when all I asked was that if she was going to be able to talk after she was done watching Game of Thrones with her new boyfriend (who was her ex,) my self-worth is absolutely rock bottom.  She has made me realise that I am the problem, that it is my fault my relationships always dissolve.  She joined me in blaming Starr for the dissolution of our relationship, but I see now that it was never her fault.  I am just completely unlovable.  I can never have more than one true friend.  I believe this stems from the fact that growing up, I had very few friends, and when I tried to expand and make new friends I got burned very badly, every time.  Because of this, I latch on to the one friend I have.  I suffocate them.  I bother them until they cannot stand it any more, and leave me.  I have tried so hard to give her space, and not ask her to hang out with me, or talk to me, but whenever I try, I get extremely depressed.  I have spent the past two weeks in extreme depression.  I was hoping that by the weekend we would be able to hang out and it would alleviate some of it, but she cancelled our plans in favour of hanging out with someone else.  Every time I ask her to do something and she says no, I get a sinking feeling.  Mainly because in the four months that I was happy, we did everything together.  Any time I asked if she wanted to do something, she was happy to hang out with me.  She was happy to talk to me nearly every moment she was awake.  I suppose that is only sustainable for so long until someone would get bored of me.  I have very little to offer, it was mainly her driving everything, and that must have been exhausting.

I am getting tired of writing, though.  I recognize my faults and all of my flaws, but I have no knowledge or motivation to fix them.  I have lived with them my entire life, and not a single person has stayed around because of them.  I am writing this because I now have zero friends.  I am completely alone.  No one in the world would even notice if I fell off the face of the Earth, or faded into oblivion.

Goodbye,

"Posting Galadriels opening monologue every day until I get a girlfriend Day 3 Galadriel: (speaking partly in Elvish)

(I amar prestar aen.)

The world is changed.

(Han matho ne nen.)

I feel it in the water.

(Han mathon ned cae.)

I feel it in the earth.

(A han noston ned gwilith.)

I smell it in the air.

Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it.

It began with the forging of the Great Rings. Three were given to the Elves, immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven to the Dwarf-Lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of Men, who above all else desire power. For within these rings was bound the strength and the will to govern each race. But they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made. Deep in the land of Mordor, in the Fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged a master ring, and into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.

One ring to rule them all.

One by one, the free lands of Middle-Earth fell to the power of the Ring, but there were some who resisted. A last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of Mordor, and on the very slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-Earth. Victory was near, but the power of the ring could not be undone. It was in this moment, when all hope had faded, that Isildur, son of the king, took up his fathers sword.

Sauron, enemy of the free peoples of Middle-Earth, was defeated. The Ring passed to Isildur, who had this one chance to destroy evil forever, but the hearts of men are easily corrupted. And the ring of power has a will of its own. It betrayed Isildur, to his death.

And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth. And for two and a half thousand years, the ring passed out of all knowledge. Until, when chance came, it ensnared another bearer.

It came to the creature Gollum, who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. And there it consumed him. The ring gave to Gollum unnatural long life. For five hundred years it poisoned his mind, and in the gloom of Gollums cave, it waited. Darkness crept back into the forests of the world. Rumor grew of a shadow in the East, whispers of a nameless fear, and the Ring of Power perceived its time had come. It abandoned Gollum, but then something happened that the Ring did not intend. It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable: a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, of the Shire.

For the time will soon come when hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.",non-suicide

"Anyone planning suicide in the long-term future?I'm a depressed 22F who is considering suicide, but not soon, but within maybe 4-5 years.
Why do I want to kill myself?
It's kind of a long story. But the main reasons are a combination: (Lack of) Economic Stability, Health Problems, Family
along with a lack of purpose or inherent value of life.

**Economic**:

Growing up was hard and I've had to overcome a lot of adversity (lower-income household, mother dying at
a young age, being a queer person of color, strict parents, depression etc), like a lot of people here.
I'm in college currently, but found that although I genuinely love learning and picked a STEM major, college 
just seems very oppressive. I know it makes me sound like an entitled, first world millenial.
My parents made me go the flagship state school directly after high school, not allowing me to choose a different school
or even CC for a few years (I had relatively good grades in high school). I knew from the moment I was on campus
that I hated it; lack of diversity and friendship, my health was negatively impacted, I didn't have a good sense of direction
or idea for a major/career and never felt inspired. I thought about transferring, but didn't have the 
resources or finances (first-generation college student), so I stuck it out though I was depressed. I did well academically
but since my major/department is kinda shitty (applied math), I'm worried that I won't get a good paying job, unlike
engineering students. Like had I known earlier, I would have just majored in that instead. I will leave college
next year with about 25-28K in loans.

**Family**:

Generally, I strongly dislike my family life. My other siblings went to medical school and basically left the house
as fast as they could. My mom died at a young age, and instead of helping me out as possible with school or becoming
self-sufficient, my dad remarried and spends his money on his new wife (unemployed) and kids, even though he's pretty old
and should be focusing on retirement. I haven't come out as queer yet, but worry that my family will disown me because of it.
(not super religous, but super conservative, strict and family-oriented). My parents are also immigrants so we don't have
tons of wealthy family here.

**Health**:
I have a lot of chronic, probably genetically-caused, health diseases since I was young.
When I was young and in my mid-teens, I was able to take care of them when my parents were employed and supportive.
After my mom died, my dad didn't bother helping me out that much and without the resources for seeing specialists
anymore, my health has decreased. It's hard at college too, because I don't have a car, and I didn't always have
health insurance to be able to see anyone. So my health continues to decrease. These aren't
life-threatening health issues, but irreverisble for the most part and make me feel insecure and self-conscious.

So because of all this, I find it hard to justify continuing life. I am kind of a nihilist and definitely 
an atheist with no absolutely no belief in the afterlife. I don't want to kill myself yet, but in 3-4 years,
when I can be more distant from my family and meticulous in suicide-planning once I'm in the ""real world"".
I've seen many psychologists over the years, but rarely find them helpful or knowledgeable, and condescending even.
It seems statistically unlikely that a queer woman of color from a first-generation college student background with severly
limited family support, chronic health issues, and student loans to be economically secure in like, even 5 years. And it's
hard to see my straight, white, male friends from more accepting and upper-middle class families succeed in life, when it's a
constant struggle for me.And even if I can push through and somehow find a way through the misery, what's the point? Why suffer and
struggle so much in life if I don't really see a reason too? Basically I created this post to see if anyone else agreed
with me and is truly planning suicide in the future.I'm also fine with talking to people about my choices and/or
expanding on the reasons above, though I doubt people can change my mind.

TL:DR: Want to wait 3-4 years before committing suicide. Basically I personally see life worth living if
I'm economically secure, have supportive family and friends, and am generally healthy. However, for a multitude of complex
reasons, all of the above factors are not really possible or likely for me. I am also a nihilist, atheist and 
don't see a point to life, other than that society has stigmatized suicide and thinks everybody born should continue living.",suicide

"Screenwriting Course Scripts and Characters that commit suicide (and other parts of dealing with depression)I've been a little low lately, so this matters to me. I'm long past the days where every moment feels like breathing underwater, so it only hurts a little.

I wrote the outline for my script a year and a half ago, when I was in the worst throws of my depression and was nearly hospitalized. And now, as I am in the class that comes after that basic course, I have to finish the script. I like how the script has grown and changed, and it certainly has a broader scope than the depression that haunted me. 

But today I had to write the little part where the character considers committing suicide. It was like I was seeing myself doing his actions. There is another character that is the voice of depression, and every line I wrote was the ideas that I had in my head. It was like writing down my thoughts, from the past. Too easy to write, which meant I could zoom past it faster, but I could never watch this script come to life. It would be too traumatic. I couldn't let other people  see that too. Especially people who know what its like.

I know it isn't the same, now that I'm much better, but I feel like I could see myself cutting to stop myself from committing suicide, or looking over the edge of a building, sad that I was hesitating and that I wouldn't do it. Confused if that was really what I wanted.

Another complexity. I feel like I've become the expert on suicide, hospitalization, therapy, group therapy, anti-depressants, and depression within my class. Too many scripts don't get it right. It's never as straightforward as they write it. Even now, it's not straightforward; a part of me, very small, wants to kill myself. A larger part of me wants to be off antidepressants, even if it means that I fall back into depression. An even larger part of me is ready to cut myself at a moment's notice, to just stop pain. And now I will talk about the script during class, like opening up too much of a wound. We will see how much it bothers me. I don't think it will too much, but who knows, right?

Someone in my class wasn't clear about what the character was doing (accident or attempt). To me it sounded like a suicide attempt, and if it is, well... I guess I'll have to tell her that there's no realistic way that she would get out of the hospital the same day. Even if it is an accident, someone would be asking her about her intent.

My life keeps getting more and more complex the farther I am from the epicenter of my depression. Not that I don't have depression (getting much closer to stable though).

I know this is long, and I though this isn't entirely related. But I just wanted to show this to people who know what it's like to consider suicide, or know a bit about the ambiguity, treatment, and reactions that follow it.",suicide

Okay, so I guess the best way to begin this is to just tell you straight up that Im gay. This wouldnt be an issue if I didnt have strictly conservative parents, I know a lot of people have it worse off than me, but I feel like most of my problems stem from this.

I havent been diagnosed as anything really, but I dont really care because it doesnt take a fucking experts opinion to tell you there is something genuinely fucking wrong with me. Lately Ive been feeling more and more suicidal, and have been planning my suicide more and more and how I could enact it with little to no effort whatsoever. And right before the time of this post in fact, Ive cut myself for the first time. Very shallow cuts, 7 of them. Worst part of it was trying to get the bleeding to stop, even now.  That and Ive been feeling like absolute SHIT consistently for 4 months now, so yeah theres definitely something wrong.

To further go into detail about the cutting, looking back at it, I snapped and started cutting, going deeper than anything Ive tried to cut and with such force and pressure. Im glad there was only an exacto knife nearby, if anything else I think I may have bled out. What scares me about this is 1. how I snapped and started cutting myself and how fast I went to cut myself and 2. How the fuck Im going to hide the cuts and if someone asks what excuse I could possibly come up with.

At the time of typing this, yesterday during work I was so miserable that I contemplated walking out climbing up a tree, tying my hoodie sleeves on both the tree and my next and just letting myself fall. I obviously didnt do this, and even if I were to walk out, Id probably wouldnt because I felt like if I did, Id just spread my suffering to my family. 

About my family : As I stated previously, theyre an adamant religious bunch, and they have no tolerance for gays, heresy and mental illness, so I have to act as if I were something I were not around them, and I think the facade is taking a toll on my mind because then I feel like I have no actual personality and that I just have to be fake around people to make them happy at the time. Ill be honest, its hard sometimes but I feel no sense of selfness I have never EVER even gave them a hint that I would ever be gay, I try to make it seem like gay isnt even a comprehensible subject and that it is something so outlandish it shouldnt exist. However, recently I have told my mother that I am feeling anxious about everything, stressed over tiny things and that Im feeling like absolute shit and Ive been considering suicide and she just yells at me and tells me Im lazy and that even I couldnt amount to anything if I gave it all of my willpower, and what hurts more than the words is the expectation being shattered. I just want someone to understand me, and to love me for what I am, and genuinely acknowledge that there is something wrong with me, and that I need help, but it just makes me so fucking sad that its never going to happen, I dont even tell this sort of stuff to my one friend because it just ruins the atmosphere and brings the mood down, so I cant just do that. I feel like I genuinely have nobody, I feel so isolated and alone. I know there are those who have it so much worse off than me, and I try to rationalize the situation in consideration of the fact, but I cant help but feeling so fucking bad.

I am scared that Im going to kill myself soon, I just want things to stop being shit, Ive been feeling like this on and off for almost 5

I have talked to both master's and PhD level therapists this year and it never helps.  Talk therapy doesn't fix anything for me.  Maybe it's because my bachelor's degree is in psychology but it never helps anything.

The days where I don't think about (bad things) are probably fewer than the ones where I do, and that makes me so sad.

Sometimes I feel like I can't do it anymore, and it disappoints me because I've got a lot going for me on paper (got accepted back to college for a second bachelor's degree recently), but most days it's a struggle just to wake up and go to my job.  I feel like I just want to go away and let the world go on without me, and I realize that's a dangerous kind of thinking that I need to nip in the bud before it gets the better of me.

I was drinking a lot this past year but I've been trying to quit for a few weeks too.  Not being able to numb myself to the same degree has led to many nights where I don't sleep well, where I get lost in my own thoughts, and where I go to bad places quickly.

I have many hobbies and I have passions, but I have no passion for those passions on my bad days.

I need to do something to fix myself.  I don't want to have this constant cloud over me anymore.  Any ideas as to what I should do?

Respectfully, please understand that telling me to just jog it off isn't going to help.  I work out daily.  I am meticulous about trying to eat healthy.  I don't drink like a fish anymore.  I need real help and I don't know what to do.",suicide
"I think I need to check myself into a hospital. I need your guys' advice.4 weeks ago I got diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. It wasn't really news, I've known I've been depressed for years (approaching 3 1/2 years now). I got prescribed Zoloft, and I'm up to 75mg now. I've also been attending therapy sessions with a psychologist for about 6 weeks now. Its not working though. If anything over the last few months its just been getting worse and worse, and it feels like it's not even getting worse at a slower rate.

Over the last few years I've made a lot of changes to try to help. I went from 198 to 150, I started eating healthier, I changed majors to something that I both enjoy more and that has more career prospects, I transferred colleges since the first one wasn't working out, I joined a few clubs and have actually made a few friends, I even attended my first college party after 2 1/2 years of never being invited to anything. Now I've finally gone to get professional help, both psychologic and psychiatric.

And none of it has helped. If anything, its only gotten worse since I don't even have the hope that any more changes will help. The hope is gone. When I was a kid, I used to get Pneumonia a lot. I had it like 5 times before I was 3. I wish I'd have just died back then, I could have saved so much pain and my parents could have moved on, now I have a ton of other people to drag down with me.

The latest ""I think I would be happy if..."" thing has been getting in a relationship. I think I'm thinking this is the latest thing, since its one of the only changes I haven't yet made, and because I pretty genuinely hate myself (I've pretty much derived any self worth over the last few years from my GPA, I don't really believe in inherent self-worth). I'm almost 21 now and haven't ever been on a date, let alone received a non-platonic hug. Nobody ever expresses interest in me, I always have to initiate (thought I've found this is usually the case with my friends as well, if I don't initiate I'd never get invited to anything). I can't even watch porn anymore without feeling like shit. It's not like I can avoid all these people in relationships either by isolating myself since I still have classes to go to. It feels like all the changes I've made over the years have amounted to nothing.

I'm just so terribly lonely and miserable all the time. I haven't been able to cry in years, so I just self harm when I feel like crying. It's not the best release, and it feels like it has diminishing returns, since lately it doesn't give me the rush it used to, it just makes it a little easier to breath if that makes any sense. Besides, it beats drinking heavily like most 'normal' people my age do (though admitably I much prefer being drunk to not being drunk).

All my friends are out building up lives and resumes and careers. It feels like I've gotten left behind on the road of life. Everyone is dating, some are already married with people they love. I get PMs from one of my friends from high school asking me if I've started dating yet. I keep trying to explain to him that I'm trying but not having any luck. Whenever dating comes up, that's all I ever get ""I'm sure you'll find someone eventually."" Thing is, none of the ""I'd might be happy if..."" things before have obviously failed, but this is the only change left I can make, since professional and medical help has failed.

I don't enjoy anything anymore. Dota 2 and CSGO feel like chores, EU4 is too frustrating now. I've already played through all the RPGs I enjoy to the point of them being mechanical to play through. I don't enjoy running or hiking as much now, and its too cold to do them anyways this time of year. I don't have any shows I really enjoy. I've always wanted to learn to draw, I'm actually a huge fan of furry art, but I'm pretty bad and I'm a perfectionist, so practicing is so frustrating that I pretty much can't do it and get better.

Suicide has increasingly been looking like the only way things are going to get better. The logic I mean with ""get better"" is that zero is still larger than a negative number, so I'd be better off. I used to think ""Ok, I'll wait until I turn 30, and then I'll kill myself if things haven't improved."" However, as things have deteriorated, I've moved that up to 25. More recently, I've moved it up to after graduation (I'm thinking It could be my own graduation present to myself). I don't even know how I'm going to make it that far. Suicide feels inevitable at this point, like its something I have to do.

I don't buy the whole ""it gets better"" thing anymore. Its been over 3 years. It really doesn't in my experience. All the medical advice I've been given when the suicidal thoughts get really bad is to distract myself. I don't understand to what end though? Like, if I don't kill myself now, then what? I get to continue hurting tomorrow? The only end this seems to lead to is ""why kill yourself now when you can just keep hurting tomorrow ad infinitum?"" I don't see the appeal in it. I think once I do it, I'll go out to a nice secluded part of one of my local national parks I like and shoot myself in the head really late at night. Nobody would notice I'm gone, possibly for a few weeks, nobody would hear a thing, I might not even be found. My body can feed some scavengers, I don't have to hurt anymore, people who love me don't have to see me hurt anymore, everyone wins. I've been dead inside for years, its just taking the rest of me a while to catch up. Of course, this is still likely a few years away, so I'm probably not at immediate risk of killing myself.

So thats where I'm standing. It's 3AM right now and I can't sleep anymore because I went to bed at 7 last night because I was out of energy and feeling suicidal again. The Zoloft just gives me headaches, makes me hungry, and gives me constipation. Nothing has helped, and I don't think I can get better anymore.

I have another therapy session with my psychologist later this afternoon. I don't know what to do anymore or what more I could tell him at this point. What should I do?

Here's what I want to do:

I'll leave the kerosene heater on in the bathroom and keep the doors and windows closed to allow harmful gases to build up. I'll overdose on short acting and long acting insulin, and I'll take over 1g of propranolol, and maybe an antiemetic so I don't vomit the drug. I'll stay in the bathroom till I lose consciousness.

And I have to say... shopping is terrible.. before you walk in, theres these large bouncer looking type men at every entrance staring at you while you walk in, and it makes it uncomfortable from the beginning.

Then the shop employees follow you around and keep and eye on you (also very uncomfortable), you cant actually touch any beauty products, like perfume etc... (why would I go shopping if I cant touch or try anything on?)

I had the same experience at every other shop, and combined with not being able to breathe under a mask... it was not a pleasant experience.

I dont think I want to go back to shopping ever again if thats how uncomfortable its going to be, I think corona is completely going to wipe out all these types of business and stores, the future will be completely online, and social distanced... and its scary.

"2929


Thats the oldest Ive ever been. Its the oldest Im ever meant to be.


I dont remember when I had the first dream. It probably happened when I was so young that I wouldnt even be able to remember. They are always fragmented and real Real in the way that when it ends, your eyes open and youre lying in bed wondering.


Did I just wake up or just fall asleep.


The fragments dont seem to follow a timeline; just clips like a hazy recollection of a night out. Remembering moments out of a long series of events.


In these dreams, Ive seen the events of my life, tragic and wonderful, play out before me. Sometimes months or years before they are experienced in the chronological timeline.


It took time to get used to having these dreams; especially the dark ones, the ones where a friend or family member passes and Im forced to spectate as a silent observer in their final moments. It wasnt until my teens that I felt like I understood what they were. As stupid as it sounds, clairvoyance runs in the family. If you believe in that type of thing. Ive cousins who experience the same. Weve talked about them, shared our different perspectives of events yet to come and those that we didnt understand until the timeline unfolded in front of us.


29


Out of the thousands of dreams, every one of which that has so far played in my synapses, not one of them shows me past the age of 29. My 30th birthday is now less than 60 days away.


Ive lived with suicidal ideation for nearly two decades now. Before I had ever met my wife, I had come to a decision. I wasnt going to live past the age of 27, in fact I was going to end my life on my 27th birthday. I cant say for certain why I chose 27 Partially because I was an angst filled young adult who thought if I was going to die young, I should join the group of others who died famously young at 27 (except Im far from famous). 27 also happens to be my favorite number, I could not tell you why, Ive always just been drawn to it.


When my 27th birthday rolled around I was a newlywed of 3 months. To say that ending my life on that day was the last thing on my mind then would be to lie to you. The plan Id concocted still toiled about in my brain that day. But my plans had changed.


29


It began to stand out in my mind that the dreams never showed me past a certain age. The limit was always twenty-nine. There are none where Im a proud father, watching my children go. None of me in my golden years enjoying life with my wife whos aged so much better than I over the years. After 29, they just stop.


We fixate on negatives, humans that is. Its an exercise in willpower and determination to train ourselves to focus on the positives in life and not dwell on the negatives. Im far from being a master at this myself.


Why dont I see myself as older than 29 in any of these?


Is it because thats when my story ends? Will my life be destined to have a dash between 1987 -2017? Am I finally going to break in the next two months and have the gumption to take my own piece off the game board?


Or is it something more positive Does the familys clairvoyant trait only take us so far in life? Is it a gift we are given to be shown, in part, the events of our future that will violently shape the people we will become? Glimpses to show us that, no matter how low and dark things are going to get, you are going to make it through this?


Maybe we arent clairvoyant. Odds are its just the family disposition for schizophrenia, another wonderful future to look forward to thanks to inherited genetics. Ive already been dealing with auditory hallucinations since childhood, though one might argue those spawned from abuse and not genetics.


Is it going to end at 29 am I going to see the other side of 30? If I dont, is it going to be my own doing? Maybe Im not allowed to see how my own story ends, not until I experience it first hand, so as to not spoil the moment.


I dont make a conscious effort to avoid my suicidal ideation. I did at one point, but then I accepted that part myself. The part that feels, knows, that suicide is an option. I cant say I go more than a week without at least the tiniest thought of it coming into my mind. That thought of throwing yourself into the void when staring into it. The thoughts just happen and like other thoughts they are sometimes discarded immediately. Others are turned and inspected; what-if situations played out over and over.


How would she react?


What would the funeral look like?


How many dominos would fall if I cast my own down? Some may topple like my own, but there would be many that would wobble for ages Likely never settling back down into their original position.


Thats the hardest hurdle for me, in regard to bringing myself to committing to ending it myself. My empathy for those in my life, knowing or at least thinking I know how my life ending would impact theirs. More so if it was self-inflicted.


It has always been easy to hurt myself. Intentionally hurting others that I care about though, has always felt impossible. I know Ive caused harm to them without the intention of doing so and felt immense guilt after the fact, again and again. So Ive never been able to follow through with a plan because of the line of thinking that happens at that point of the planning.


Within the next two months am I going to finally disregard others feelings and selfishly satisfy my own, Im not even sure what to call it, desire or what I believe to be my stories already written ending? Perhaps it does end, but not by any doing of myself. Just the chaos of existence.


With some luck, maybe Just maybe 29 isnt the end Its just a new beginning.

"I can't live with this thought, I feel sick. During last summer, I developed a sense of high anxiety around being in the company of young people/babies that I'd never had prior. This was a result of feeling intense distress over finding out that an ex teacher was a pedophile. I came to realize in March this year through research that this is called POCD, which provided me with a lot of relief.

In the late evening of Monday, 23rd September 2019 after having moved back into university halls of residence for my second year a week prior, I basically watched pornography for around about 2-4 hours intermittently when my depression was as its worst height. I'd already experienced false memories by this point.

Anyway, for that whole afternoon and night, I would go from grinding/humping against the bed (an awkward way of doing it that I developed when I was in my early teens) while watching Porn Hub on my phone, to then sitting up and watching random videos on YouTube.

The second to last video I watched was a video of Kurt Cobain and his 2 year old daughter, that appeared on the homepage after going back from Porn Hub and sitting up in bed again. At this point, I remember thinking that if I were to watch this video, I shouldn't watch another video afterwards, purely ''because this YouTube video had a baby in it'' - even though I knew deep down that the two videos were entirely separated by tabs on my phone, not to mention obviously by content. Nevertheless, I watched the interview video, scrolled through the comments and paused at a specific point then went back to Porn Hub, and only then did I kneel down to grind the duvet again, but with a video loaded.

Finally, I remember sitting up again and going back to the YouTube homepage and the first video shown was a slideshow of Cobain's daughter through the years and I remember feeling so much guilt for having watched the prior porn. The reason for this is that - as best as I can describe - seeing her (as a baby, the pinnacle of innocence) exemplified the essential humanity that we all have, including the adult performers. As a result, I felt heavy guilt (that I now realize to be misplaced) for being what I considered to be ''anti-feminist'', and an ''evil person''.

Perhaps I overthink the morality of things, I don't know.

My brain at the time immediately started to go into overload and overlap what would otherwise be two separate actions of watching YouTube then lewd stuff. I remember going to the sink afterwards, and dry-vomiting.

With regards to the actual first-person recollection of possibly staring at the Cobain video, I have no explicit sensory memory of this. The 'image' in my head is grainy at best. I wouldn't have been able to live with myself were this the opposite.

After leaving the bathroom and panicking a lot, I walked through it step-by-step, and eventually felt comfortable enough that I hadnt done anything wrong and so I left it. This, as a general worry didn't reappear again till May 2020, with the rest of 2019 being spent going from day-to-day worries and false memories. I even felt happy and content on New Year's Day this year.

Surely, if I'd done this horrible thing, I wouldn't have been able to feel anything happy ever again?

At first, I wondered if I did do it, and I just repressed it, or I didnt and actually its just my overactive imagination mixed with my anxiety. I know that in my heart I didnt do anything wrong, as I had listened to Nirvana plenty of times afterwards, and didnt feel pangs of guilt or shame that I know I wouldve if Id done anything wrong.

Things have gotten better mildly. My first appointment with an OCD therapist is soon. I'm currently on the fourth day of taking a beta-blocker to regulate my heart-rate and blood pressure that helps ward off the panic attacks I have about it. I'm trying to sleep better, but sometimes the image creeps in too much. I'm due to get a new set of the anti-depressant mirtazipine soon, too.

But even with that, it all feels like too much right now and I'm more suicidal than ever about this. I don't want to die over an image in my head, but is this a belated guilty conscience? I feel sick and can't think or sleep. I have moments of 'you know you're being silly, start living again', but then it hits my head over and and I end up in bed depressed for another week.

I worry that I might, out of a morbid curiosity, have done it. I remember faintly thinking how awful it would be to do it, and then - as far as I know - not doing it.",suicide

"no rewards for resistensehi reddit. i am an anon. i do not know why i am postting this reaaly. perhaps a chance to hear myself speak? perhaps an open forum to categorise my thoughtS? perhaps just because... and because is enough.

ten years ago i gave up on life. i crossed a lne.

it's not despair or depression that keep me beyond that line. it is fatigue.

a member of my family was suisidal. to my knowledge they still are. we don not speak about it. we are unable to now.

i supported them for years. dropped out of school to work and finnancially keep them afloat. i cooked. cleaned. i managed our lives. while they drunk. got depressed.

they had been committed to a mental institution once for a failed attempt. i still remember the smell of that building. the glazed eyes of the patients who were being medicated there. the woman who began a conversation with me saying that she did not kill her husband and the haunting knowledge that i first heard the phrase ""never say goodbye, that is forever. only say see you later"" from her lips.

three years i supported that person. because i love them. we were all the other had in the world. i was too weak to stop them drinking. how could i take away their vice? what else would they do while i worked?

their depression grew stronger. i soldiered on.

eventually it got too much. another failed attempt. they had already taken the pills before i got home.

i always blamed myself for not dealing with them when drunk. i supported in all ways but never well enough.

we argued. i was tired. empty. had nothing left to give.

i yelled at them. i told them how i would benefit from them giving in and just doing it. they did not back down. they called my bluff. they told me to do it with them.

that pure and perfect opportunity to just exit. in that moment i was ready. i was ready because i had given everything and the atlas struggle would finally be over if i just did not fight or resist anymore. if i just let reality wash over me and consume me. ---to this day that feeling of surrender is one of the best emotions i can remember. i was ready.

they backed down when i agreed. they saw what their attitude had done and in a moment of selflessness my family member backed down.

we sat up that night. the pills were still in their system.

they did not die.

years pass.

i move on.

they move on.

that night lives on as a memory only in my head. there are times i wonder if it happened at all. how would i know if it had or had not.

time kept pushing on me. struggle after struggle came and i conquered them.

while caring for my family member i had developed an ability to weather these storms. push through. get through. keep your head down. survive. endure.

god it's such a struggle.

that memory of surrender haunts me.

but i have family now. i have friends. i have people who need me.

so i weather.

i endure.

i found the best way to cope with life is to disassociate with it. not take it on board.

i no longer know how to handle compliments.

my years of training under a suicidal dependant have made me terrified of failure. if i do not live to every expectation i will make things worse. i will cause an episode. i need to do everything. for everyone.

i make life a struggle. i keep heaping on these challenges. taking on more responsibility. breaking myself.

and i never feel satisfaction.

that's the worst part. i don't even feel relief anymore. once i've accomplished something. i just press on.

that has become my life. add on more. feel more pressure. never release. never pride. only failure.

i'm so tired.

and i don't know how to ask for help. i cannot expect anyone to understand. i try so hard to explain it but the words do not come out right.

""you should feel pride""

""take some credit""

and if i speak up they take the rug away... ""you should not do so much"" ""you know what happens when you push yourself""

i feel worthless when that happens.

so i just disassociate. stop thinking of myself. stop applying my self to anything. that way i no one will bother me. no one will make me feel worse by trying to rescue me.

i do not feel sad. i do not really feel happy. i just go with the flow. think about how others feel all the time. live to make them happy. at least then my presence will be worthwhile.

i fake it.

i fake it because i can not remember how to be honest.

when people try to get in i kneejerk push them away. i keep trying to push past that. all i can do is offer content without emotion. i cannot apply myself to any story. to any pleas. i just sit here rotting in the back of my brain.

where no one will be dragged in to my void.

where no one will watch me dead on the inside.

where no one will offer pity.

no shame.

"I just feel like there is no point delaying the inevitableI've graduated from one of the best universities in my country which I'd got accepted with a scholarship and national degree in university entrence exams. I've graduated with 3.2/4 gpa score. I've gone to Sweden with Erasmus programme, I've played in a great band for the first 3 years of my university life, had been selpt with 5-6 women which I had a serious relationship that last 2.5 years with 2 of them. I've graduated and got accepted for the graduate school that I wanted and currently I am studying Game Technologies. My first ever game had got downloaded by 2 million people during my first job experience. This year at 14th Februrary, everything was changed. My girlfriend dumbed me for a fuckboy, my parents got divorced (and they were very verbal to me about this topic), I had to swtich jobs because I thought I was underpayed and being used there and now I am working in defense industries (totally different industry that I'd imagine for my career). I dont know, I think I've accomplished much during my school years but whenever I look back I say to myself I could do better. 

I could do better if I was living in a different country, I could do better if I didn't waste my time on two long serious relationships. I could do better if I decided to study abroad and just accept my parent's offer to pay for it (I didn't want to make them pay for MY education). I could do better if I didn't have a girlfriend when I was living in sweden with eramus programme. I could do better if I didn't stop making music or writing poems and stories, I could do better if I didn't take the job at defense industries so early that quitting the job means getting banned from the best paying sector in Turkey. Everything I did seems like a failure to me. And worst of all, I've gained a lot of weight, my self esteem is on the ground, I just stopped believing myself or in other words I stopped lying myself about I can accomplish anything.

Anyways, for people around me, I am a succesfull, mature, intellectual, functioning person with interesting hobbies. But inside of my mind, these things just doesn't matter. I was so pumped by my parents, my friends and my girlfriends, nothing I do satisfies me and I am feeling like I am slowly losing all my skills (social, artistic, general etc.). 

I dont add value to anyone around me. Noone needs me, Noone craves for my love, needs my support, needs me around them. 

I was such a nice guy to all my friends and lovers. But in the end I was the one who got screwed up by them. I can not seem to get laid nowadays, if you exclude some of my ex gf's. that really affects me because I was used to have a regular sex life (and boy, it was great). I cannot meet with new people and make them like me like used to. I could sit on a table that I know only one person at that table and carry the conversation for hours but now I am just struggling with even answering the basic questions. I used to have strong believes about life, politics, relationships (I'm an atheist), and know I realize that these believes just made me loser in the end and I cannot change them because they are infused into my mind. 

Turkey is a very depressing place if you have at least slightly above the average intellectual capacities, and I feel like I am trapped in this place where people are sooo terrible; muslim-heads who long for the glorious days of ignorance and bigotry of ottoman empire, wannabe ""highly cultural"" social media slaves/plaza workers, bigheaded academics who doesn't give a shit about their thesis student, women who satisfies themselves with shallow relationships or expects irrationally much from men, people who cannot appreciate a good company and keep expecting a personal benefit from every relationship they have. 

Fuck I am so overwhelmed trying to describe the state of mind I am in, I am so sorry people. I wish English was my mother tongue, but it isn't and I am not confident the way I express myself. 

This life, is too complicating, too demanding, too shallow and most importantly too worthless especially in Turkey. I want to leave here, but I don't know if I can find the happiness and peace in another country. Here, I am an intellectual, succesfull computer engineer; outside of Turkey, I am a fucking roach. I've sent my cv to a lot of places outside the country. Noone wants me. How do I escape here? Should I escape here and leave all of my successes and failures behind me and start a new life? Would it worth the effort? I don't know.

Death, seems like such a sweet release to me. I just want to die, naturally, at this moment, in an instant. I had enough. I had my peak  at this life and I am just slowly going down to a horrible end I can feel it. I've been depressed before, even got some medical treatment for it. It doesn't feel like being depressed at all. It is just... there is no meaning in anything at all. We are bunch of atoms. Dying will just stop all of it. I wouldn't care for anyone and anything If I was dead. I wouldn't be upset about the fact that I could do much, have children and stuff. Dead doesn't care. Dead is dead and for the last month I just feel like there is no point delaying the inevitable. ",suicide

However, it is one that is weighing on me and I feel so low that I want to die. I'm a 30 year old woman and have never been ""lucky"" when it comes to dating or relations, however I met someone last year that I felt I connected with. We had so much fun together and I loved to be around him, and we ""dated"" but I felt like I was not good enough to be his girlfriend. He was hungup on an ex girlfriend and when he talked about her it would hurt me each time, I felt like I would never be good enough compared to her. Why was she good enough for him to date but not me? It messed me up so much. He would say things like ""I would be the luckiest guy if you were my girlfriend"" or 'you would be the perfect girlfriend"". At the same time he would brush off discussions I've tried to have about relationships and would say ""you deserve a nice boyfriend"" and things like that. The whole ordeal made me feel awful about myself and I have been in such a depression. We still text but I don't try to have serious conversations anymore since he moved for his job anyways.

"here's my debate for why violent video games reduce violence IRL I'm having a debate competition and the motion is this house believes that violent video games lead to violent acts in young audiences, so o figured this would be of some help against the banvideogames subreddit, (it's not too good rn)

most of the time we commit violent acts because we're angry or frustrated, by commiting violent acts in the game we vent these emotions out in the game instead of in the real world, say for example DOOM(you know the drill we all like BFG division). you might say that video games can culture some really toxic people, but speaking into a mic and speaking to a face are two different things, I have friends that literally gang up on me and ban me from their Minecraft server because they were in a bad mood, the next day I had a few words to say to them and they just stood there and let me run my mouth (I just didn't feel like letting them have their way so I did a thing), that's why I think cyberbullying isn't a problem, if you know how to treat is properly(my own opinion, you guys might know something I don't)

I am so lucky, that everyday I get to call this wonderful human mine, and I get to call him cute everyday. Things have been hard with covid, we've been apart 315 days, which is, to most LDR's silly, but he's my only friend. I...am a pretty lonely person, but that's alright. I have about 2 other close friends and that's all I really need. He's literally my best friend. He's been with me through everything. Like I said, I have a toxic home-life, my father is a POS and my mother...she isn't much better. Before him, I knew there was something mentally wrong with me, and to this day my parents still don't really believe I have an anxiety disorder and I quite possibly could be depressed. (not being dramatic it's rough.) He is also my first, well everything just about. This is the first real-real relationship I've been in, he was my first kiss, my first slow-dance, my first everything. He's so timid and gentle and knows exactly how I'm feeling even if I don't tell him initially. He tells me he's proud of me, and the first time he told me that, I broke down into tears. No one has ever ever told me they were proud of me, he sees the smallest steps I take and he recognizing me for them. I've been working my hardest on not apologizing so often and getting a grasp on my anxiety. I know to some now, it's so silly to think that you're first relationship is the one you're gonna marry. But I so truly believe he'll be the one I marry, I want to get married to him, I want to have a life with him. These past 4 years, I haven't felt sad, like ""unneeded"" sad, of course I have days, but he's literally lit my life up. I wrote a poem about/for him last year and in the poem, I talk about how he re-lit my ""spark"". My spark is well myself, my personality, my happiness, my passions my all of it. I don't think I could ever begin to repay him. With everything he's done...I'm overjoyed. And I tell him all of this everyday and he takes it with such modesty, or ""I know I'm all these things, but so are you"" He knows me, he knows who I am, he's the first person to ever willfully get to know who I am, and to love every, single, inch of me, even the parts I can't love right now.

I think I'll stop there for now, I could novels upon novels about my love for him, but I think now is a good time to stop.

"I want to end my lifeI just need to vent I have no one I can tell this to.

I moved back home to my grandmas after a stressful two years of college and a failed relationship due to drug addiction on both parties. We were both insanely depressed, I thought I did the good thing moving back home but everyday still feels worse. I miss him so much it hurts. He just overdosed again two weeks ago and I heard hes doing better but Ive decided to go no contact, but I miss him so bad maybe Ill do minimal contact once hes feeling better.. Ive had suicidal thoughts in the past, but its gone out of control since moving back home. My life has no direction or meaning. All I do is bother everyone. My mind is so hazy that I cannot focus. Getting out of bed is insanely difficult. Going out in public feels like everyone is either scurrying away from me or staring at me, I know its my head playing with me man. I feel like a monster and it feels like everyone can see it. Its hard making friends and I dont want to bother my friends down here. 

I had a decent job paying me 15 an hour but it was insanely stressful, when I moved back home I applied to jobs near me and quickly got one as a front desk agent at a nice hotel paying me 10 dollars an hour. Its definitely slower paced and cool but the down time is absolutely killing me. My thoughts eat my alive.

I hooked up with an ex two nights ago because I craved being touched but obviously I feel 10x worse. The sex was meaningless he was just ramming my cervix the whole time but I didnt want to ruin the moment or make him mad by saying it hurt so I just waited for it to end. We smoked after and chatted for a bit. Played some video games and cuddled and fell asleep, well he did but I just stared at the wall for hours. It felt so good to be high again. Yesterday morning at work I was really irritated because my cervix feels insanely sore, I got no sleep, and my emotions are completely out of control. Im usually sweet but I felt like a ticking time bomb all day. 

Housekeepers told me to call my boss so they could print their reports because no managers were there. I told them to call them because I was busy, but they stood behind me for 10 minutes while I took phone calls and did my paperwork because theyre english is bad and they wanted me to do it... they were communicating with me just fine. So I snapped and said what do you want me to do?! Did yall call them like i told you? they said they called the gm and my boss but they didnt answer their phones and they left a voicemail. So I dialed the sales manager because i knew she was awake because she called me earlier, and she gave me an attitude on the phone and she dates my boss, so he got on the phone and yelled at me not to call her. I said I only called her because him and the other boss didnt answer their phones, and to never speak to me in that tone again and maybe they shouldnt tell us to call them whenever they arent there if we need help if they dont want to help. So whats the point in their numbers posted on the bulletin board, I ripped it off and told the housekeepers that I cant help them and to please go away.

I had so much downtime of just standing there and reading news articles that I opened word and typed how I was feeling. It wasnt meant to be a suicide note, but I did mention how I wanted to do it. Which is unimportant but if anyone is interested, I want to drive far away listening to music until Im tired, then I want to drive into a body of water and drown. I dont know when Ill do it but I fantasize about it every day I drive home from work. Im too coward to shoot myself or hang myself. I dont want my family to find me. If my body is found I want my ashes to be spread in fields of flowers and trees. I thought I closed the word document, but I have ADHD and would lose my head if it wasnt attached to my body. So I had anxiety all yesterday that I left the document open and my boss who yelled at me called me at 11:55 last night and Im wondering if that is why. Why else call me at that hour. Maybe Im overthinking. 

So now Im thinking should I not show up to work? Maybe have a me day? I dont even know how to have a self care and love day. Im just too scared to go to work :( I dont know if anyone would even care to read this. I feel so lost and lonely. If anyone wants to talk, Id be so happy to...",suicide

"Planning to kill myself at 29hey guys

let me start by a brief intro

im 14 and live in canada. i have shitty fucking parents and i have no life

my life is a repetition of study 24/7 then piano 24/7 and secretly game 24/7 (yes im asian, korean to be exact), swim 24/7 and read boring ass classic books 24/7

so my teenage years are looking like theyre gonna get fucked and i dont think i can handle me getting old as well

so i thought of this brilliant idea that if i dont want to get old, ill just kill myself

before all this, i always thought that death was interesting. i read a lot of articles about death and read philosophical korean manga about death.

im curious to what happens to 'me' after death.

i dont think this curiosity and this low key depression will go away

so ill just enjoy my life till late 20s then just kill myself.

"Just When I Think I'm In The Clear...I was so sure I was over this.  But, goodness, this new bout I slammed into is, by far, the worst I've felt in a long time.  I understand we're all trapped in our own heads, but I've never felt so tethered down like I have by this awful, sickly feeling that has been plaguing my thinking nonstop the past five days.  I know, I know, nobody should get so upset as to contemplate suicide over a girl or guy not taking an interest in them - but dang, I'm not one to feel so strongly about a potential relationship often.  At all.  So when I do, and I know I'm not doing well, it feels like I'm missing an incredibly important game changer for my life.  Yet, here I am again.  Plastering this girl with my anxieties as I try to approach her about anything.  And this one going wrong is just another lump.  Another screw up in a long line of nothing but screw ups for me.  Another nail in the coffin, as it were.

And it's not fair to her or anyone else who is subjected to my behavior.  I feel like I was just settling into great work relationships with these people at my new job, and then I go out and get drunk with them a few times and tell them all about this girl and my anxieties.  And yesterday at work when I tried to joke and talk to the girl...holy crap, I'm an idiot.  And a creep.  Then there is this other girl I really respect who is roughly the same age my sister would be had she not died years ago, and, during one of our drunken conversations, she told me how I was like ""a little brother"" to her.  Of course, this makes my heart swell with pure joy, but then I wonder how creepy does that make me?  I'm just a weirdo who pushes away people who genuinely try to care about me by getting too clingy.  The past two nights, I'd go out drinking and just tell myself (aloud unfortunately) how it would be best for me to just get this whole load of crap over with.  It upsets my friends who were drinking with me.  They genuinely do care, but I can tell this attitude I have is weighing on them lately too.  Who can blame them?  It's terrible.  And the more I think about it, the worse I get.  And the worse I get, the more I think about it.  My descent into pure, unadulterated, 100% self hatred is nearly complete.  All of this boils down to one question - ""Am I ever gonna be good enough?""  It just doesn't seem like the case.  Anytime I get a good opportunity thrown my way, I don't know how to handle it.  I've failed to adapt to society and the world.

Some people are still crazy enough to care about me for some reason though - probably mostly thanks to biology, but I've been slowly pushing away my family in addition to my friends and coworkers.  This is nobody's fault but mine, I know that.  I just don't want to hurt anyone.  I'd rather not put my parents through losing another child.  But, once I've got a safe enough distance between my family and me, I may genuinely consider checking out.  It's definitely become a legitimate, daily consideration again.",suicide

"Do you guys notice how some commercials and shows increased their black cast/presence? Do you notice the increase of black people in commercials and television?

Just a disclaimer, I am African American. Im sharing an observation and this isnt an invitation for a racist discussion.

2020 was a wild year when it came to racial injustice. All of these protests and demands for change made me very happy and proud.

Obviously, companies see these protests and come out in support and thats fine. But some shows and commercials seems like pandering rather than a genuine desire to increase diversity.

I was watching a paper tower commercial and it was a black animated family. I see a lot of new shows adding a number of black people to their cast. I see Harvard pledging to admit more black students. And many other commercials that you wouldnt usually see a black face on.

This is all great until you realize that a lot of these companies only do this amid a protest that pertains to race. Ive never seen this rush for diversity when instances are normal (normal meaning not a huge public outcry for racial reform). 

Maybe Im reading too far into it but its just what I noticed on television. Companies putting a black face as the star of their commercial and calling it progress. Its upsetting and these companies should have a genuine desire to push for diversity rather than pushing for it when its convenient to show that you support an agenda.",non-suicide

"Does anyone else feel like they were neglected by their parents just because you were never a problem child? I know this isn't really a thing to complain about, but i've always wondered if anyone else felt the same

I wa thirdborn in my family and homeschooled for the first 10 years. My mother had to school my rwo older brothers before I came into the world and this whittled down my mothers patience. By the time I was needing to be schooled, my mother was already busy enough with my other brothers that she didn't have the capacity to give me very much attention. 

By the time I was able to read well on my own, my mother would just plop a textbook down in front of me and I would go ahead and study on my own. I learned rather quickly that my mother had little patience when I asked for help twice in a row, or took too long to figure out easy stuff. Yelling and occasionally beatings would follow so I stopped asking for help altogether. 

From that point on, almost everything I did was on my own. I would start to fear help itself so I would kick my rear into overdrive and focus the hell out of my times tables or whatever it was that I was studying just to avoid help altogether. 

It wasn't just with studying. I was for some strange reason really sensetive to yelling and I would prefer a beating rather than a scold on pretty much every occasion. Because of this, I learned cery quickly how to be a good boy in the house, not making any trouble whatsoever. Never causing problems and never having any that I had to ask assistance with.

I had fun by myself in those times. Jigsaw puzzles and puzzle books and jacks and whatever other 1 player games I could find, I played them. Keeping all the possible problems I could cause to a minimum.

A decade down the line, i'm now older and in high school. I do exceedingly well in every class and never cause a problem for anybody. I do find myself without a social life which I considered to be a waste of energy at the time. I've also noticed that all my exceptional achievements are going pretty much unseen by my parents. I believe that they just got used to how I was never a problen and now its standard in their eyes. I grew up always being great and pushing into greatness even further is exceedingly difficult.

Now i'm 19 and I feel in sort of trapped in this image I created for my parents that I ""must always be perfect"" and ""never cause a problem"". I've worked so hard to keep this image but I feel like its tearing me down.

I feel really down all the time now. I just feel so unmotivated and unhappy. The ""good boy"" in me says to ignore all that emotional bs and just keep moving along, but its harder and harder to do that every passing day. I just feel depressed. I hide it all from my parents because this would be an issue that I would be putting onto them. ""Sorry mom, but your 3rd child has a problem"". Also, I don't even know if theyll care.

And looking back on this whole situation, I feel like I have only myself to blame. I feel like I was the one who caused my parents to not care about me because I never wanted them to care about me and I avoided it whereever I could.

I'm the one who caused them to look at me the way they do.

"The Cold Sore Did Me InLet me prefix this with saying that cold sores are not that bad, but it was enough to push me over the edge. 

So, I've only for sure had one, and I may have had one or two more about a month or two later--but they didn't have apparent symptoms. The point being is that I haven't had anything since my first initial outbreak two years ago. Combine this fact along with the fact that I thought 80% of the population already had it, and that it was very rare to give it when you do not have symptoms. I was wrong. Only 60% of the US population has it (40% is far to high for me to just not care), and you can fairly regularly give it when you have no symptoms. So, now, if I ever want to kiss a girl again, I have to warn her that I've had cold sores, and I also need to avoid oral sex because I might give my partner it down there even without any open sores. 

So, this news is too much for me. I'm already miserable at my job (I've been looking for new work for three months now--my city's economy is horrible). My friend groups are breaking down (mainly people moving away or getting into relationships and forgetting about their single friends). I am not close with my family. And now, I can't even date because I'm a disgusting man who might give you cold sores. 

No, I am not the ""typical"" person who you find on this subreddit. I have numerous hobbies, I stay in shape, I (I guess now formerly) was successful with women, and I had quite a few friends. But I'm lonely. I've lost my three closest friends in a span of six months (one moved, one hates me now, and the other decides that his gf is all that matters in life), and they really were like family to me--especially important since I'm not close with my own. Professionally, I'm going no where and will probably be laid off in May, and, based on my city's job market, I won't be able to find work. Therefore, I am about to become an unemployed and lonely man who is undatable. 

It's the calmness--that's how I know that I'm close. The despair makes you unable to do anything, but the calmness let's you have the energy to end it. Thanks for reading, I appreciate you taking the time. ",suicide

still, i've never been able to completely move on from thinking about suicide: in the best of times, it's distant and amusing-to-think-about, in the worst it's a seriously-considered recourse. i just can't seem to feel fulfilled by any of my relationships, any of my accomplishments. even though i imagine by most accounts i'd be considered a happy, sociable, well-liked person, i feel like i just want to tie up my responsibilities, distribute my things, and get lost. almost unconsciously, i imagine the feeling of the barrel of a gun on the roof of my mouth, or what it would feel like to jump off a bridge or jump into traffic.

"Never EndingIve been going through shit this past year. My mental health has plummeted these past months and Ive been fantasizing about self-harming all year. My oldest sister has been going at it with my mother and they sometimes get into heated arguments. My sister referenced her wanting to end it all after a fight with her boyfriend but the only thing my mother &amp; father said was that people go to Hell if they do that. Thats the only thing that matters to them. For me, the road to Heaven is already ruined because of my sexuality. If Im going there anyway, whats the point of waiting? This isnt the first time she referenced this before. My mother has seen me look depressed and thought it would be best to tell me that if I commit suicide, I will burn it Hell. I was to self-destruct. I see why people take drugs. I need to feel. Dreaming about slitting my wrists only soothes me for so long. I cant wait to get away. 21 years of living and no one has ever loved me. Im a worthless closeted homo and I feel that world is laughing at me. I will finally get the last laugh once I hang myself. Didnt want to ruin Christmas but now since Christmas is over, I have nothing holding me back. My depression has turn into anger. Most days, I feel rage and isolation. Nothing really brings me joy in this life.",suicide

But now they look super sharp and cramped and generally unpleasant for the eyes. As well as that, they also turn white, black if you use light mode,Im guessing.

"I feel like my girlfriend is pulling me downHi, Ive been a long time lurker and finally convinced myself to post something too.

So, for start, Im a 17 year old boy from Chech Republic. Ive been struggling with depression and anxiety for about 3 years now, but Ive never hurt myself. But since 6 months ago, when I met my new girlfriend, I feel like Im too obsessed with her to the point where I started choking or even cutting myself when I felt like she was mad at me.

I have pretty fragile psyche so this shit can really put me on my knees. It happens daily. It got to the point where she almost broke up with me. But I knew that if she would leave me, I would have no other purpose in life. I dont know if Im just too optimistic, but the only future I can see is with her. I have no friends, my family treats my like shit but she doesnt. Its just my mind putting me in a state where I think she treats me like shit because I deserve it so I deserve to suffer.

Is this a healthy relationship? I know that if we ever break up Im going to kill myself, but I want to change, I want to be the best she can ever have, but I dont know why.",suicide

"First times thinking about suicide recentlyBeen on antidepressants for half a year now - things have only gotten worse since taking them. Recently started thinking about what the repercussions of suicide would be, and what would happen after i die. How would I do it? Whats the quickest, most efficient way thats least painful? I dont even wanna act like Ive got some huge sob story and my life has been doomed from the start. Im just sick of hating myself and wanting to be somebody else. Im tired of waking up and wanting to go back to sleep, even though Im not tired. I wanna just sit in a metal box and stare at a wall for a long while. I wanna just stop existing for a little while. Im so burnt out. Not even from school. Im burnt out from life. The nice thing about it all, though, is that I kinda like the power of not caring anymore. Im about to graduate high school and go to my dream college, and all I can help but think about is how much I dont care about my future anymore. I dont care about the consequences of my life anymore. Its nice to not care about all the little things that used to make me hate myself. Now when I screw things up, instead of feeling like crap, and just think about how it wont matter in the long run since there wont be a long run. A part of me hopes things get worse so I can just off myself and not have to care anymore, so my fuck-ups stop having power over my mentally ill brain.",suicide
"The Dispair Islands and its residents The Void Islands are a group of Islands located on the surface of an almost dead dimension. The Islands are likely alive and they demonstrate their lives by changing position and shape every 279 years. The Island is inhabited by a tribe of natives called ""the Wave Missionaries. In 1478 DC another group of humans came to the islands and pillaged most of them, in 1480 began a war  between the Wave Missionaries and the aggressors.  The Missionaries were led by Hato, the best swordsman in all the Islands, who was gifted by the Wave a set of divine powers. The aggressors came from a never specified location and were led by Irwin Wardlock. The war ended in 1487 after the fall of Fort Hijo. After that Hato decided to pass down his powers to his family. In 1501 he mysteriously disappeared leaving a note saying ""I'll return, I just listened to the Wave calling me, it was not a pleasant invitation. It was a scream of pain"". 371 years later a city is founded after the alliance of the Missionaries and another batch of humans called Londinium. 28 years later a relative of Hato, Grica Wallace Irwin, sets out to find the truth behind the shady actions of duke Abraham Lucas and the fate of his long lost ancestor , Hato",non-suicide
"My suicidal thoughts.I am typically a person who tends to internalize a lot of my problems and do not usually express when I am feeling depressed or sad. However I do want to express these problems and talk about them. I know I need help with this because I have obsessed over these thoughts for years now. I am constantly of the mind set to judge if life is worth it or not, wondering how much more of existing can I stand before I just put a bullet in my head. I feel like the mindset I hold is undeserved and pathetic. Some people undergo such profound suffering for these thoughts to manifest and it's almost no wonder they do. But I have not suffered any great tragedy my life is easy, so easy compared to most people's it's pathetic. I wake up do household chores for an hour or so and play video games with my friends all day. The only great stress I have is how I will manage to grow up. Because it seems I have the lifestyle of a child when I am at my transition into adulthood. But this is also paired with the realization that the life of the average joe that lives in a part of the world with the highest life quality is doomed to the majority of their life being tedium and suffering. And that is not me just speculating I have had jobs in retail and a fast food restaurant. So I have experienced working in lowly entry level jobs and going to school and both suck the majority of the time. So I am stuck left wondering what the fuck do I do that isn't awful? I fear my life is going to turn into a game where I pick jobs hoping one of them will be good only to realize they have all sucked and then uh oh I'm real old and the majority of things I have done in life I have regretted well fuck me I guess I'll die. I just feel so lost, I am trying to find a path in life where I am not doomed to suffer the majority of the time and live for those small bits of time where I can do what I please. I want to live for what I like all the time but I'm afraid that's too greedy, too much to ask for, the majority of people don't how could I go beyond to that state of blissful existence? Does it even exist? Am I chasing after something that can never be attained? And if that's the case how do I endure the suffering? Because I feel like I am weaker than the majority I am pathetic when compared to the majority. People have endured so much more than I have yet they still have the will to move forward when I am here wallowing in despair over the inevitable suffering I will face in the future. One day I fear when I finally face my moment of profound suffering it will give me the willpower to end my life.

"There's nothing life can offer me would make living worth it.I'm 22 years old, diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.  I tried to kill myself by overdose last Christmas but landed in the psych ward instead.  I self-harm fairly often.  Sometimes that has kept me from trying to kill myself because I go numb when I cut.  In the past couple years I've been in and out of the hospital.  I spent 6 months in a partial hospitalization program before they gave up on me.  I've been in a mentalization based therapy program for the past year, but it hasn't been very helpful.  My family thought it might help if I got a psychiatric service dog, but I can't because one of my flatmates is deathly allergic to dogs.  It doesn't seem like any amount of therapy or medication has made me want to stay alive.  All I can do is cut to distract myself from wanting to die.

We broke up because she constantly lied to me, she didn't show up when we planned to go out the day after I tried to kill myself. She didn't come to school for over two weeks and she went out with her ""friend"" who she promised she would stay away from as she keeps trying to make her take drugs.

It got to the point where on the night I broke with her, I flipped a coin, if it were heads I would break up with her and if it were tails I would kill myself. Thankfully it was heads but I'm getting back to that stage again.

"How do I give support for someone I'm growing to despise?Little background: Few years ago my parents got a divorce and my mom began a (somewhat abusive) relationship with someone. Last year my dad died.

Shortly before my dad's funeral it became evident to my mom that she was being cheated on and the dude was going to leave her. So at our dad's funeral my mom was crying, not because her ex-husband had died but, because her boyfriend had left her (I know that my parents marriage had ended and she didn't need to feel bad about it, but to me it was extremelly disrespectful to me and my siblings --- at the moment nobody knew why she was so sad). Few days later, we were stil mourning our dad's death and the reason for her sadness showed up...

Now because her boyfriend have left her she is treatning to kill herself. Jesus Christ, My 50 years old mother is treatning to kill herself because her 36 years old boyfriend have left her!

She became insuferable, her facebook is filled with disgusting messages, posts and whatnot about how everyone is garbage and life have no meaning; she have turned away any attempt of help from any relative. She treats her 73 yo mother like shit (I believe that in her head my grandma have something to do with her being dump). She spent her new years eve on a psych clinic but isn't taking any medicine because of no apparent reason and I think that she is straight up lying to her doctors.

She is just making the lives of everyone miserable (and for me, because of the most retarded reason possible) and I don't know how to deal with it... before I try to help and just making everything worse: how do I give support if I can't stand her reasons and am in fact disgusted by it and by her actions? What should I do?

They also stopped letting me talk to or see my nieces 6 months ago. I was manic and delusional and put in the hospital for three weeks before they stopped talking to me. I was stable after a few days but that's how it works (especially when you have good insurance). My brothers took my dog to the pound while I was in the hospital, that devastated me and I was pissed at them when I got discharged. My family said they would stop talking to me if I didn't go to ""psych rehab"" (I haven't ever done illegal substances either than weed) but I wasn't about to be locked up again after having been locked up for three weeks. Or do what they say after they betrayed me like that. I think what my family did to me and is doing to me now is disgusting, it fills me with rage and sadness because I also feel like at this point I can't (and shouldn't) ever forgive them. They will never apologize and I don't see how that gets fixed without an apology. I have all the criteria for suicide and have been suicidal in the past, I can't believe they are abandoning me like this it puts me at a higher risk for suicide and I wish I would do it just to make them feel bad. Just to get them to see the seriousness of the situation. I'd love to post on facebook that the decision was made because on top of feeling like I have nothing left to live for and feeling like I can't cope with my pyschiatric issues anymore (or the side effects of the medications) my family doesn't care what happens to me either so what's the point? They have used me to vent their anger, made me into a joke and used me as a scapegoat my entire life but especially this year. I'm so fucking sick of being left out and abused I wish I could get back at them somehow.",suicide

"I think I'm done.I see no point in continuing my life. It has been so long since I became disillusioned with this world; the pointless cycle of work and pain to enjoy such small things for such a small time, the uncaring populace that hurts and abuses itself, the vast majority that feel no empathy. I see all of these reflected in myself too, another idiotic follower of the human condition, driven purely by emotion and not by logic. Why anyone would want to live in such a torturous existence is beyond my understanding.

I was born too early to escape it, too. Perhaps a few hundred years in the future space travel may have advanced to a level whereby some reasonable scale of exploration is possible, and I could just leave this hellhole behind, and things may have been different. But as it stands I will be long dead under any circumstances, unable to see the one thing I have dreamed of.

Only music and video games have stood between me and this. They allowed me to hide my dissatisfaction with the world inside myself and ignore it, so I didn't have to deal with it. But they haven't worked now for a good few months. The one time I found something besides those that I thought may have been worth living for was brutally wrenched from me.

This is not a decision I have made without considerable thought. The last couple of months have shown to me just how much I hate this world. Knowing that so many other people feel the same has solidified this.

Nothing I have tried has helped. No antidepressants, no therapy, no thought mechanism has eased the pain. The one person I had trust in and who could help me ran away into the arms of another man, and now I am at wit's end. Nothing stands between me and the hell and that I always tried to avoid, so what's the point in even trying to live with it. I just want to fall asleep and never wake up, never have to feel a thing again. I want to be free from the tyranny of sadness and depression, free from the cage of anxiety and panic. I want to die.",suicide
"Read my old suicide note tonightRead my old suicide note tonight

A while back (couple months ago, so not too long ago) when my mental state was particularly bad I wrote out a suicide note. I didnt have anything to say to my parents or any of my friends except one. I dont feel like I need to give an explanation, Id rather my issues die with me rather than existing in other peoples heads. I wrote the letter to the only friend who Ive fully opened up to, and I was prepared to do it. Instead, I went to sleep. Ive been struggling lately so I went back and read that note and got this strange sense of comfort. It made me feel so relaxed, maybe it was the idea that if Id gotten that close to killing myself before and hadnt, I could do it again.",suicide
"Is it selfish telling someone?I'm thinking about opening up to one of my cousins. I'm not really close to him or anything, but he comes down to visit the uni I go to sometimes since he recently graduated. He also tried to get me into his frat and all, but I also feel like I let him down as I left during the process. I want to open up on how I tried committing and the other mental problems I have. I don't want a pity party or anything like that, I just want someone to know, especially family (as I'm usually always the 'loner' and don't really mingle well with others). But, I'm hesitant because I don't know if I'll try to commit again. I don't want for him to get hurt and all because of that (even though he'll probably already feel bad about me dying, but I don't want it to torment him or something).",suicide
"What's the easiest way to kill myselfPlease don't put ""don't kill yourself we need you!"" Or anything in the comments, I'll do it with or without your help, but for my sake I hope you help me. I'm 15 I have 2 mentally abusive parents. I've been able to stop their abuse for a while by doing everything they want but now I'm failing school. It's started every thing back up so much worse. I get really full from my big school lunches but my mom forces me to eat when I come home, but then when I eat she asks why I'm being a pig. Im healthy but it's not enough. Im trying to juggle school and their chores for me but I can't. I'm sorry, I'm a coward and I know it. I can't run away because I don't want to be out there alone, I'm scared of what would happen to me since I'm a girl. I've tried looking into national runaway service but I would need a safe place to stay I really need y'all's help. I'm to much of a coward to cut or hang myself or anything violent but we don't have any pills that could do the job. What can I do? I can't last here 3 more years I just can't, I had a boyfriend that was helping me a while back but they texted him pretending to be me and started a huge fight with them and then they blocked him on my phone. He was so sweet and kind and it's been months since that happened so I'm sure he's so mad at me he wouldn't even consider helping me at this point. I have no one else. Please help me",suicide
I need some helpI feel really terrible right now I spent the entire day burning my self with matches. I really need to talk to anyone to help me feel better or I'm not sure I'll wake up tomorrow,suicide
"I'm probably mad to post this and I regret you reading it I'm not over emotional. Or at least, I'm not the kind who cries in movies or songs. And I hate to cry.

So why in the hell could I not go through one night this week without crying??

I could never relate to all you guys saying ""I feel so alone"" or ""I'm depressed"" and I always felt like an outsider in this sense. I mean, I have a great life and I don't like people complaining when they have a great life too!

I won't go into details here (simply because it's boring) but I consider the life I'm leading extremely lucky.

And suddenly it was like a ""welcome to the club"" moment. 

And I always ask myself, *what changed?* Is this a teenager phase that will pass soon? Or is this more... real?

I have no friends other than two guys I met online and never actually met. I can't find myself. I have a beautiful family: but it just feels like they don't know me. I'm constantly bored. And I go on walks everyday just to get out of this life - even if it's just for an hour. And seriously, why? As I said, I have a great life. So what changed?

I don't know why I'm writing this and I don't know why you are reading this, but it feels good somehow to do this. So thanks I guess.

"This is the only place I can talk about thisUsing a throwaway account because I need to get this off of my chest but Im scared of speaking out fully as people I know irl know my reddit account. 


For the last five years Ive been slowly growing more and more sad and upset with life due to my own stupid mistakes. 

I have a loving family and sure we dont always get along but I love them all to pieces.

The stupid mistakes I made haunt me to this day, no one knows about them besides me and the people involved, and that kills me. I have so many passions I want to pursue, like my singing or my art however Im terrified that if my face gets out there one day Ill wake up to hear everyone I love knows what I did. 

I was so so fucking stupid and if I could go back I would have stopped myself. It was only five years ago I found out what I did shouldnt have happened, that I should have never done it and since then its been creeping up on me and eating away at me. 

I cant tell anyone about it who I care about and if I went to see a doctor and looked for help, Id be scared someone would find out, Im scared Id break down, Im scared Id lose my place in college.

Ive thought about killing myself so many times, I even tired not taking my crohns and colitis medication for a while, hoping this illness would kill me slowly, but kill me none the less, but my mother soon found the full pill boxes and injections. 

It feels like a huge weight is being dropped on my head. I wasnt forced to do what I did, I was a stupid child who didnt know what they were getting into or how bad what they were doing was. I was naive and now itll haunt me for the rest of my life, however long thatll be anyways.

"I hate the reddit hivemind If your opinion differs even slightly from the generally leftist points of view on most subs, then you get so, so much hate. Harsh personal insults from people who claim that they are fighting against bullying. The hypocrisy. Calling your opinion ""not real"" and '""bullshit"" while flaunting their own. Keep in mind I said nothing sexist or racist, just appropriately shared my opinion on a sub. I knew it would get hate but how could I know that full grown adults would act so immature and attack someone for having a different opinion. I am not right wing in any way, but I can see how people can turn into bitter far right racists with equally terrible views from this. I hate people who claim to have an open mind but have no room accepting that people with different opinions exist. My comment on r/niceguys may have been unpopular, and I'm not offended by what people say, just shocked that grown adults can be such shitty people hiding behind a screen. I pray to a god, if one exists that I never become as bitter and close-minded as they are. You can check my post history for yourself and see if you think my opinion was worth me being called many names by people almost three times my age.

"Last ditch effortWhen I was a kid I was abused by my biological dad. I've had a speech impediment my entire life that makes me sound mentally ill. No one takes me seriously. When I was in middle school I was relentlessly bullied. On my second year of college I was diagnosed with Luekemia. Unfortunately, it didn't kill me. My mom and dad divorced and it was so ugly. After I dropped out I realized I was trans. Now every day someone says something to me about how I'm a pervert or a freak. People online are so vile. My anxiety has been ruthless since I was a child. I can't hold a job because I get too scared to go in after the 3rd day. I'm 25 years old, don't have a job, can't keep one. I'm fat. I'm bald. I'm trans. I don't have any worth because I can't labor and so I'm just a parasite on my dad and mom. Every job I attempt (dozens) ive failed at. Its so much. When i do work i come home crying, and in the mornings before i go in i get so scared I throw up. But you need money to live and I dont wanna keep being a burden and pathetic

I don't know what to do. I've tried dozens of medications. Multiple therapists. I was on disability for a while for the cancer, but it ended now. I'm too anxious to leave the house. I'm too anxious to make phone calls or work or do anything. What options do I even have left besides killing myself?

"Should I leave a note?I am a 20 year old female. My parents decided that it was a good idea to have a baby with someone they met at AA and subsequently divorced when I was 4. I've been in therapy since I was 8. My first psychiatric inpatient admission was when I was 16 but once I graduated high school, everything went downhill. 

I've tried university but it's so lonely. I'm supposed to be in my 4th year but I barely have enough credits for a single year. I was in the gifted program so all of my high school friends are out there achieving great things and I'm just here binging and purging. Since I've turned 18, I've spent aprox. 10 months, mostly of a form(involuntary), in a psych ward. I've tried ECT twice and I'm only 20. I'm scared that it gave me brain damage because my memory is still fucked. I've tried about 20 different medications. 

Well, I see a social worker, psychiatrist, and a therapist weekly. I'm on disability. Would it really be that much of a surprise to my loved ones? It'd be selfish of them to want me to continue to live this way. I'm diagnosed with Bipolar II, BPD and Bulimia Nervosa. I am just a failure and a burden. There is nothing to look forward to except misery. My friends leave me. My mother just complains about how much money I cost her. Everyone is going to die and I have such trust/abandonment issues that I cannot trust my bf not to cheat on me. 

I can't tell my psychiatrist that I got the pharmacy to refill that bottle of pills security wrestled from me because he will just put me back on a psych ward. I just want to die. There is no hope at all. I don't want to wait until I'm 30 and just be in a worse position. There's no god because a god wouldn't let someone live in such agony. What have I done to deserve this? I try to go to school and smile but it just feels like I am attempting to evade my destiny.

Besides a living will that will say to take me off life support if heavily brain damaged, is there much point in leaving a note at this point? It's pretty much expected at this point.

"My life is falling apartHi all, 

This is my first and maybe last post on here. Ive had a pretty easy life. I went to good schools. I have wealthy parents who always loved and supported me and pushed me to do the best in life. I have a girlfriend of 2 years who I love so much. I worked in Canary Wharf ( UK Version of Wall Street ) as a foreign exchange broker for over a year and I was pretty good at it. I left that job a few days after I turned 21 to start my own brokerage. I have a group of friends who are always there for each other, my friends are my second family. We always have each others backs. My life should be perfect ya know. Middle class white boy with his entire life in front of him. Then it changed.

A few months ago I was involved in a car accident with a cyclist. I was driving home from my girlfriends on Mothers Day and just didnt see them. I missed the first one somehow but hit the front cyclist. They died a week later in hospital. In a few weeks, after the police have concluded their investigation I am going to charged with Death by Dangerous Driving. It carries a minimum of 2 years in prison and a lengthy driving ban. Due to coronavirus the firm helping me setup my own brokerage has folded, I lost all the money  I had already invested into my firm from website design and the such, which was pretty much everything I had. My girlfriend is leaving me due to the fact Im going to prison for 2+ years. Shes also leaving me for a guy she works with, turns out theyve been having an affair since early December... and he sexually assaulted her. Apparently Im just that bad of a boyfriend she wants to leave me for someone who sexually assaulted her. Most of my friends no longer talk to me due to the accident and the stress of the entire situation is putting a huge strain on my dads already very weak heart. My mum cries most morning and nights over it. 

Ive always felt like I was a burden on people my entire life. I feel like Ive let people down my entire life. I wish I could be someone different. My brother for example. He is a national swimmer, he has a masters degree in motorsport engineering and is currently an assistant lecturer. He has a house he rents with his friend in Coventry. My parents were always so proud of him. Although I said earlier that my parents loved me and supported me they have never been proud of me. They found out I smoked in year 9, I was never part of a sports team in school, I wasnt popular. They felt I wasted my potential playing video games and going out with the few friends I had. 

So basically Ive decided to end it. My entire life Ive let people down, disappointed people and now everything is falling apart around me. Ive lost my friends, my girlfriend, my company and soon Im going to lose my freedom. I had everything and now I have nothing. I used to be sure of everything and where I wanted to go in life, I wanted to bring my friends and family and girlfriend along with me. 

Now its just me. Alone in the dark, lying in bed at 1:42am on a Tuesday morning. Im not sure when Ill go through with it, maybe a few days, maybe a few weeks or maybe when Im in prison.

"I'm heading back into that direction...Sorry about the length.

A little back story. I spent 3 years working as a nursing assistant where I worked nights, drove my GPA into the ground and spent most of my time binge drinking. One day I tried to drink myself to death by drinking three bottles of vodka. I don't remember much about that night. I blindly texted a few friends but I was told it was incomprehensible. I woke up to a trashed apartment. I gave my landlord my 30 day notice, submitted a request to be switched to evening shifts at my job, told my psychatrist what I did who promptly increased the dosage of a mood stabilzer he was giving me (for a mild case of type two bipolar he had diagnosed me with) and recommended a cognative therapist who specializes in alcohol abuse. I started seeing him reguarly and I thought I was doing good. I started hitting the gym and I ate healthier.

I made a miscalculation though. I thought that switching to evening shifts would make me less moody. Instead I was overwhelmed by the number of coworkers, supervisors, and politics I had to deal with. I got into nasty fights with my long distance girlfriend who had stuck with me through all this. We broke up twice in a three month period due to my insecurities and lack of trust. I'm afraid to tell her anything now because I'm afraid I'll lose the support I had when I was binge drinking.

I'm in the same rut I was before, I feel desperately alone and depressed. The therapy has made sense and has helped a little but its only been able to go so far in two months. Its hard to not beat yourself up when you've lived alone, isolated from about a dozen people for three years.

 I feel like all my hard work has been futile now. I stopped going to the gym, I only recently stopped heavily smoking pot to escape. (The constant introspection began to drive me mad.). I feel like nothing has changed. I'm still miserable and I'm still afraid to go back to school even though I want to become a therapist or a social worker. I haven't felt this terrible since I trashed my apartment. I'm worried if it gets worse I may take up drinking heavily again and try to drink myself to death.

tl;dr Was in a rut, tried to kill myself. Got help, and now I'm crawling back into my hole.",suicide

"And here I am once again.Back to feeling extremely suicidal again. I made a post in /r/depression a few days ago, hoping I wouldn't get this suicidal again. I tried to kill myself a few weeks ago (not in a way I had to see a hospital) and I never told anyone in real life about it. 
My family knows I'm really depressed and they wish they could help me. My mother tried so hard to make me feel a little better, it just doesn't work out at all.

I have too many repressed memories. I'm sick and basically stuck in bed, can't go out and do things, yet alone go to school or have a job. I'm alone. Well, I'm not ""alone"", I have many people around me, I'm lonely. I was dating a guy who was just like me. He left me, so I would get better. He thought he was dragging me down more. He was the only one who made me feel better. I miss him a lot. It's been 6 months and I still feel just the same way about him. I'm tired of people telling me ""you will get over it"" and telling me I will find someone better. I won't. I have never felt attracted to anyone ever before in my whole life, except for him. And he didn't leave me because he didn't love me anymore or for any other usual breakup reason. I can't forget about him.

It's not the breakup, it's the loneliness combined with all of my problems. Things just keep getting worse for me day by day and I just feel lonely. I wish I still had him, it was all I needed. I just can't get through this alone. I can't. It's too much.

Now, I have to cancel all my plans and I'm too embarrassed to tell why. My bandmates have given up on me, they found someone better to replace me. My grades are falling fast. Is it better to just kill myself? I don't think anyone will care, and I won't have to face people anymore. I think I'm going to do it",suicide

"Back here again...I don't know if this happened on its own or because I quit the meds that I don't think I need. They all say I'm bipolar and give me these bullshit placebo pills that have hardly done anything. I seriously doubt I am, and so I quit the meds that I don't need. I don't experience the very common triggers, nor do I experience the physiological and emotional extremes associated with that disorder. It's all a misdiagnosis. I know it. I don't care if three doctors agreed with it, it's all wrong. These are the wrong meds and they are going to ruin me.

The thoughts came back. I keep going through almost cyclical periods of wanting to go through with a gender transition, only to completely lose interest weeks or months later. I don't know which side to trust. I was going through treatment for it, but I ended up quitting for some stupid fucking reason. Now it's flaring up again. When it flares up now, it flares up to an EXTREME extent. I can't make rational decisions, my emotions are very unstable, and I become suicidal and engage in self-harm. These periods can last from a week to a few months. I don't understand why it's so intense. I literally cannot focus on ANYTHING else besides the idea of transitioning. The thoughts plague me night and day. It haunts me in my sleep. I'm afraid to go to sleep now. I just can't do it. I don't want this to be any worse. It will only get worse as long as it's not being treated.

I'm almost certain this is going to get worse and it's only the first day of this 'flare-up'. I'm in an incredible amount of distress right now. The suicidal thoughts are starting to come back. I can't relax and breathe. I can't get anything done. It's transition or die. There is no other option.

I won't be able to transition in the near future. By then the treatment will have a minimized effect on me. I was fine before this two years ago. It worked. I was fine. Then I wasn't. I'm fucking done with this shit. I'm done. I want to end it. I don't give a shit about anything else at this point. I don't even know how to do it since anything I could use has been removed from the house after previous attempts. But I know I'll find a way if this gets worse. I don't know where this is going to go and I'm kind of scared. I don't want to end up back in the psych ward.

It's not just this stupid transgender crap that's fueling this. I also have a bunch of other psychiatric problems that are keeping me from getting anywhere in life. My therapist even told me that out of all her patients I have the most problems. Thanks doc. I'm told I shouldn't expect to be able to sustain a real 9-5 job that pays well. It's either part-time min wage servitude or disability. Either way I won't be able to pursue the gender transition. This leaves me with no choice. It's going to end soon. ",suicide

"It feels like it's creeping up on me, not sure how much longer I can go on with it.It's been exactly a month since my mother died at the age of 51. I always considered myself to not have to worry about the scenario until I was in my 30's, but here I am dealing with it at the age of 19. I've been criticized and pointed out at how well I'm coping with all of this happening for me, but deep down inside I'm hurt like the rest of them, I'm just desensitized from all the quarrels, problems, and depression leading up to it, not to mention nightmares almost every single night since then.

It used to be just my mother, myself, and my brother all living together. My father left because of a relationship dispute some time ago when I was younger, but he has still been there for me. But since this has all happened, it has felt like nothing but control over the situation. He doesn't want to support me and my brother financially while he's the only one with a job right now, and he can't support us socially because he lives in another city. The most he's done is tell us to get a job and start manning up to the responsibilities that my mother used to take care of, but to be fair, neither me or my brother have had the willpower to do anything since. I want to go and see a grievance counselor with my brother, but procrastination, depression, and anxiety has been getting the better of both of us, and I doubt my father would be willing to help in that regard.

I feel really broken right now. Unable to work and keep up in today's society. Everyone's pushing us forward, telling us what to do, how to do, what we need. I feel it's only a matter of time before either me or my brother hatches an idea and it plays out like some sort of dramatic movie. I asked my brother today how is he feeling today, on a scale from 0 being like any other day, to 10 being that he knows today is his last. He replied 8, I replied 6, although that's probably just the desensitization talking, and I'm probably more closer to 8 or 9.

I feel like this is all revolving around money. It doesn't feel right at all, especially considering that my mother used to get paid spousal support, and she'd spend that money on me and my brother. It now goes all back to my dad and haven't seen anything since. I've tried speaking up against my dad about this, but the most he does is hold what little he supports us on right now over our heads and asks if we want his support or not.

I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know how to live. I definitely don't know how to help myself. A lot of these things, I would have asked my mother to hold my hand and help me do them. She would give me so much support through it until I was able to do it myself, but now all I get is tough love.",suicide
"In 2016 I was really sick, I wasnt supposed to survive. I really wish I hadnt. My pain would have been over then.In 2016 I had both MRSA and pneumonia at the same time.

Each cough brought up blood and mucus. All those coughs, From the first to the last were like knives in my rib cage. After I was released I was coughing up junk for almost 2-3 weeks.

I was treated with large amounts of mucinex, prednisone, levofloxacin and inhaling water like it was air. I was on large doses of Narco with an anti nausea medication for the pain. Why didnt I die then?

I later found out I wasnt supposed to survive according to my doctors.

"Lied my way out of the psych ward.So a week ago I made a post asking if I should tell guidance about my failed suicide attempt. Someone said I should and I decided to do it. I ended up going to a psych ward as I thought I would and I just got out yesterday. I was telling them that I felt better, when in reality I still feel like killing myself. I just didn't want to be in there anymore because the doctor didn't give a shit. I told him that I wasn't feeling good when he asked how I was doing, and he said ""If I went to the grocery store, and asked how the clerk was doing, I expect them to say good, because that's the polite thing to do. I don't want to hear their whole life story all I want to do is pay for my thing"" which made no fucking sense because it's not a grocery store it's a fucking psych ward. I'm supposed to be honest with how I am feeling. After that he quickly wrapped the conversation up and the next day he would talk about his life. He clearly didn't give a fuck. I want to tell my therapist that I am thinking of trying suicide again but I am scared to go back and I don't know what to do. Any help would be greatly appreciated",suicide

"[Important] TikTok is NOT for kids. TikTok is a shady and mostly unmoderated area place with porn.

So this is just plain bad. Kids in GRADE FUCKING THREE are using TikTok and have (probably) seen porn before because of TikTok.

Types of porn on TikTok include people showing off their bare butt, full body cam of naked people, and girls showing boobs.

So TikTok is a place if you're willing to see porn. Otherwise go elsewhere safer because you're not supposed to go on TikTok at school.

However, our school district not only blocks the website but also the API so TikTok is blocked, even on the mobile app.

While TikTok might be an ""excitement"" during the COVID pandemic, TikTok is NOT a safe place. Make sure to read the reviews of the app, website, or product before downloading/accessing it.",non-suicide

"Suicide is not an option for me. That's not just a tired saying, it's my reality. But if it's the only thing I can think about, where do I go from here?I cross-posted from r/depression. I'm sorry if you see this twice. 

I've been lurking here on my main for a long time, and I don't know that I fit in. I'm sorry if my situation isn't relatable. It sounds really stupid.

I have a great life. I know many people are alone but I'm not, no matter how much I keep trying to be. I try to push my friends and family away but I can't. I had a pretty traumatic childhood, but all those people have been out of my life for a decade and my remaining family are amazing.

Suicide is absolutely not an option for me. I have too many people who care about me (I know, I know how this sounds). Once my dad and grandma pass away, then it's very much on the table - friends and other relatives may be sad but they will get over it. However, my dad was a young parent and therefore is very young and healthy, I've got a couple decades before that becomes a reality. Sometimes I resent that, and that's the darkest thought I've ever had. I've never told anyone this before, but in my worst moments I am upset that my dad - my favorite person in the *world* \- is still alive and healthy and going to stay that way, because that means I have to stay alive for a few more decades too, and I really don't want to.

I'm also gainfully employed, in a job I used to love, and really should still love. I'm not wealthy but I can support myself. My job is incredibly stressful but my coworkers are good people, my boss is a good person, I believe in the work, and it pays the bills even in my very expensive city.

I have friends, and the ability to have more friends, but instead of going out and socializing I just keep pushing more and more people away.

I just don't know where to go from here. I feel like I have to keep it all up - working, being a normal person, or faking it as best as possible. I isolate myself a lot, I never go out, but still my friends are there. It's very weird and confusing. I don't know how I got so lucky. Not only are my friends still around no matter how much I avoid them, but they're all very cool people - they're intelligent and successful and have so much going for them in their lives. I don't know how I've tricked all these people into being my friends, or how I've tricked my job into keeping me employed, or how I've tricked my family into being so supportive. But I have, and I need to undo all of this without hurting anyone.

I don't want to be alive anymore. Every time a minor thing goes wrong that thought hits me like a ton of bricks. Every time I'm alone, and I'm alone *a lot,* all the same. But I don't know what to do. I feel so fucking trapped. But my amazing, supportive friends and family would be absolutely crushed if I told them any of this - and they'd probably have me committed. They'd probably try to make me quit my stressful job, as most of my complaints about life to them are framed around my job (which is stressful, yeah, but a mentally healthy person could handle this - hell, even a slightly-more-healthy version of me from a few years ago could handle it). Then I'd have nowhere to go, nothing to do. My friends and family would get tired of me and I'd be in the same situation as so many people who are alone.

It's like I've got it backwards. I have no reason to be depressed right now, but I am, cripplingly so. But if I tell anyone, my life will be turned upside down and I'll have a genuine reason to want to die for the first time since I was 12.

I just... don't know where to go from here. I'm sorry if this was rambling and hard to follow. And I'm sorry if this sounds self involved or bragging - I don't understand why I've gotten so unfairly lucky in life, either. I wish someone more whole had all these good things going from them. I would genuinely love it if nobody would miss me. I know that sounds awful.",suicide

"I'm finally at a breaking pointI have no idea why I am writing this right now. I'm 29 and I'm a fucking loser. I'm a miserable person who sees all the negatives in any situation. I've fucked up every opportunity life has ever given me. Everything to me seems stupid and pointless and I can't seem to find enjoyment out of anything that doesn't involve deep fantasy where I can forget who I am for brief periods of time. 

My parents sent me to two different schools and I fucked up each of them for years and got no degree. I have no real skills that can get me a job, I've been unemployed for two years straight almost. I finally got a job four months ago and got so stressed out at a night time security guard job that I had to quit it was making me so incredibly miserable. I'm pathetic and I have no idea why I was feeling what I was feeling. I can't put it into words, I'd just go to the job and start to feel panicked. I ended up having to find an excuse to quit even though my parents asked me not to. 

Now I'm sitting here jobless wondering what do I do? Even if I get a job is it going to stress me out to the point where I can't handle it? Probably. My father thinks I'm a fucking loser and a disappointment even if he won't come right out and say it. He's ashamed of me and that crushes me, but there's nothing I can do. Shame is something I've come used to, it scares me less than the stress I am going through. 

I've never had a girlfriend, I've never really kissed a girl, I've never had anyone love me back. I've never had someone I could put my arm around and say ""I love you too"" to me. I live completely alone without another living soul around me. I didn't used to drink until I started that job four months ago and now I do it just to feel 'normal'. Like just doing what everyone else does when their depressed makes me feel slightly better. 

I've been laying completely in the dark for hours crying because I have no hope for the future. I'm almost 30 years old and there's nothing good out there coming. I've squandered every opportunity I've been given and it's just too late. I'm a burden to everyone around me. I tried to tell my parents how I felt around the holidays but they didn't get it. They were worried for a few days and kept asking me over and over how I felt until I finally said 'better' and then they figured I was past it all. I wasn't. 

They told me I need to talk to someone, but I can't afford to go talk to a professional. And even if I did, where do I start? How does a professional take my fucked up life and make me want to live it? There's no digging myself out of this hole I'm in. I'm stuck and I'm going to stay stuck. It's too late for me to start changing, too late for me to get a girl, too late for me to fix how I get when I go in public. So fuck it, right? 

I'm crying and screaming at the top of my lungs and I just don't know how to make it all stop. I don't know why I'm putting this in the suicide watch Reddit because I'm too much of a coward to kill myself. I want to do it, but I'm too afraid. I've tried before, but I always chicken out. I'm useless even at that. 

Again, I just don't know why I'm writing all this. I'm somewhat of a writer, maybe I'm hoping it'll make me feel better? I was wrong. Now I just feel embarassed ontop of it. Jesus, what do I do? Do I keep limping along, making people ashamed of me as I keep fucking everything up? Wouldn't it be BETTER for me to just end it? ",suicide
"BreakupIm 30/m and my girlfriend 21/f left me two weeks ago. She was unhappy sexually b/c I'm not old enough for her. She kept it to herself for 2 years thinking she could change the way she feels about me. When she was a child/teen she was abused sexually by older men and now that is all she is attracted to. She did not expect to fall in love with me when we started dating. I wanted to get married someday. NEVER felt this way about anyone before. Now she is gone. She told me that maybe we could try again but that she would need to make a big change in her life and isn't sure that it would ever happen. Seems like she doesnt want anything to do with me and she said its because it would be to hard for her and me to be in my life. I am going crazy dealing with this. Eating sleeping and getting work done are very difficult. I try to not call her or text her but I usually cave and do it at least once a day. I go by her work and new place to see if shes there at night when I can't sleep. Im really fucked up. I am 2 years sober as well which makes this harder. I cant run from the pain i get to feel everything. I think about killing myself. I just feel like its all getting worse and I cant change it. When I was trying to get sober I thought about killing myself a lot for the same reason. All this work to do and no energy. Ive come to the conclusion that doing work, whether for money or personal growth is the way to being ol and somewhat of a whole person but I just dont know how. I have all this work to do and I dont have the energy or give a shit enough about anything to get started. I know objectively what is supposed to work. ""Dont talk to her"" ""Get work done"" ""Distract yourself"" ""Get exercise"" Has anyone been in a situation like this?

I want to be dead. I once thought that human problems were surmountable, but they're not. 

They're just not. I only want to live if I can think of a scheme in which humans aren't doomed, and I can't. I've tried and I can't, and that depresses me. Everyone I've ever loved is going to die; I'm going to die. Everyone works hard for things, which they forget about when they die. Everyone feels pain. There's so much agony in the world. So much madness. Small animals by the millions are being poured into grinders alive; their meat comes flowing out a tube, like shit from an anus. Young children are beheading people, but tiny baby arms are so weak they saw the heads off slowly. And then other children listen to music that's merely people screaming. Screaming! This is a world of endless screaming. High-school graduations happen, and the young men and women without scholarships walk away, knowing that they will live lives of struggle, which will be harvested as tax dollars for the state, no differently than the way human batteries are harvested by the machines of The Matrix. The planet is suffering and the minds able to come up with schemes capable of reversing the damage being done are killing themselves. The leaders we elect have values, not plans or schemes. Human history is filled with torture, slavery, and suffering. I hate being human. Most of my friends are depressed because I find happiness intolerable: pathological happiness in the face of this worlds past, present, and future, seems like a crime to me. Every religion secretly prescribes nihilism. Humans exploit one another in life, because nature has been overridden by the state, thanks to human nature. And I feel worlds away from it all. I don't want to participate in human affairs, but go in direction completely opposite to wherever this leads. I don't have any hope for humans... I just hope... That this is all some kind of simulation, intended to teach me how not to behave. What if evolution made us miserable, so we could survive? I don't feel like anyone can relate to me. I don't feel human. I don't understand what I'm supposed to do for you. I don't understand why, as I've aged, I've become more sensitive, and not less. The adults who raised me were so stupid, that I assumed I would become numb when I grew old, but it seems like the complete opposite has happened. These feelings. Was I programmed to function in a smaller world? I drive down the street, and it scares me: that I have this urge to meet everybody I see, but I roll past them like they're nothing. And I'm nothing too. What's the point in being a nothing that feels something? And there's no such thing as help. People don't help; they help themselves by getting jobs. One of my only older friends, she's really jaded about life; she feels like it let her down. She told me that I should try not to obsess over these things (our world and universe is eating itself); that people who do, do end up killing themselves. I just can't though. It's getting harder and harder to wake up in the morning, and when I do wake up I'll go back to bed to cover up my disgusting self. I will delete this post, to cover up my disgusting self, but I promise I won't kill myself. I feel so torn, because I want to like existence, but I don't. And it's the only existence I know! And that hurts even more. 

If only I could go somewhere else. ",suicide
"Ah,I feel so apathetic to everything. All I do is cause people pain and yet I even feel numb to the guilt. A very, very small part of me is scared of potentially hurting someone badly in my life and it makes me wanna kill myself. The rest of me is kind of hoping I hurt someone and that part of me also makes me wanna kill myself so I can leave a lasting impression on whoever knows me and/or whoever finds my body.

If this gets much worse I think I will go through with it. Or at least attempt so if I survive I can feel something, even if it's just suffering.",suicide

I might be less depressed, but it wouldn't go away.

I'm tired of being told to get help or open up to someone. The only advice you ever get is ""it gets better"" and ""think about your family"". Well, I don't care anymore. I'm tired. Why is not wanting to live so frowned upon? I tried living, and it's not for me. Stop trying to save me and just let me die painlessly.",suicide
"Dont think I was meant to be a mom, maybe I'll kill myself insteadSince having my baby in January I've been increasingly depressed, angry, and anxious. I know its probably PPD and PPA but to be fucking honest, I dont care WHAT it is. All I know is I want it to stop. I dont enjoy being a mother. I got pregnant at 19. Just recently had my 21st bday. So I'm a young mom. I kept the baby because I thought I was going to be a good mom. I've worked at daycares. I've always been good w kids. I always wanted to be a mother. And I LOVE my baby, with all my heart, but I'm just not a good mom. I hate not being able to do anything anymore. Always broke. Cant even shit on my own time. I dont sleep. My baby is 9 mo old and still wakes up up to 8 times a night. I dont like my appearance. I don't like sitting home all day. I dont like the sound of my baby crying. I don't like changing 10000 diapers a day. I don't like not being able to do ANYTHING when I want to. I miss independence. Freedom. Having a personality other than tired and stressed. Friends. Going out. Relaxing. Having goals and hopes for my future. Lmao, all the goals I had are gone now. Cant go to college when all your money is being spent on formula. Cant go to college when you dont have a babysitter. Cant get a good job without college. Etc etc etc. I'll amount to nothing more than a mother now. And for some people that's enough. But I feel like I may as well be 50 already, just say bye to any semblance of youth i have. I don't think its right to my daughter to have a mom who doesnt wanna be here. I don't think it's fair to my boyfriend to have to deal with me. I will NEVER be happy away from her so leaving and starting over isnt an option. Cant undo my baby in my brain. But I will never be happy doing this either. I just want to quit. I want to die. I want her to have a better mom. I want her to not see anger from her mother. I want to not be conscious or aware anymore. I want to cease to be. But I'm terrified I'll do it and get stuck on the other side watching her from afar. If I knew 100 percent death meant emptiness and conciousness death, I'd have done it long before now. And I've struggled w depression, bi polar, borderline personality, my whole life. I don't see it getting better. Just worse. So why stick around?",suicide

"Day 5 of posting things related to the Internaional Waffles Day(Google must be confused about why I searched for this every day) Waffle Day has recently begun to be celebrated in other countries as well, often ushered in by restaurants and cafs specialising in waffles, as in India, where the Belgian Waffle Co. in 2018 declared that they would celebrate National Waffle Day in July, or in Norway, where Waffle Day was all but unknown until producers of waffle irons, milk and flour started to promote waffle day in the mid-2010s. In the United States, National Waffle Day is celebrated in August to commemorate the date of a U.S. patent on a waffle iron; however the celebration is described as ""at best a 'bizarre' or 'unique' holiday  the fluff stuff of radio DJ commentary"", a frequent criticism of food celebration days.

"I'm a disgusting piece of shit and here is my rant.I'm so fucking done. I recently moved to the other side of the country for my internship, better said: to work fulltime without even getting paid. I have literally nobody here; all my coworkers are at least ten years older (seriously), I can't join any sportsclub or other activities around here cause I'm not an official student so I'm not welcome there. All the parties and activities I'm welcome at, are full of old people (as in at least 40 y/o).

I was so glad that I got invited to celebrate the newyear at my boyfriend's appartment, but yesterday the flu kicked in. I was up the whole night (8pm till 5am) vomiting bile and it hurt so much that i even had to sleep sitting up. It was horrible. So, I asked him if he could please, just please, come over here, instead of having that stupid fucking party. But guess what, he'd rather be there ofc. He'll maybe come later tonight, around 11pm, just to fuck obviously. I know he's totally obsessed with the girls that are gonna come to that party ('I just think they're really interesting', yeeah well, especially with those seethrough dresses and giant push-up bras, right.), and it just hurts so much. I never felt wanted in my entire life, and even he, after all this time, won't spend time with me. He's probably gonna break up with me soon cause I'm a depressed, hidious piece of shit with no friends who's always yelling and ruining everything. 

Things were finally getting better for me; I quit drugs after using almost half of my life, I started to eat better and to exercise, but nothing helps. I'm still the same disgusting whore, and I don't know what the fuck to do. I'm probably just gonna go to that stupid party, eventhough it's two and a half hours by train and I've been vomiting my brains out for the past 24hrs. I just really want to feel like a whole person, okay. I don't want to die, but trust me, I want to, if you know what I mean :/",suicide

"I've got everything going for me and yet...Hi Reddit,

This is my first time posting ever. I need help. I've been diagnosed with major depression and anxiety. I take my pills every day. I'm surrounded by people that love me. I've been told I'm pretty, talented, funny, nice, etc. I have a boyfriend. I have a loving family that is paying for my college education (though I dropped out because the depression was so bad). I have a roof over my head. I was in a sorority surrounded by tons of friends. I used to be a division I athlete before I dropped out. Everything is right in my life.
Everything, except me. I'm miserable all the time. I honestly want to kill myself. I've tried twice to hang myself but it didn't work. All I got was the impression of a rope around my neck. I've never felt this down in my life. I think of all the mistakes I've made and I just wish I could go back in time and relive my life, knowing what I do now. I don't know what to do. If I didn't live in a state where it was so hard to get a gun I probably would have shot myself a long time ago.
I know this is just rambling and probably doesn't make any sense, but I just want to get everything out.

My parents are confused as to why Im just disobeying them and my dad is getting even angrier at me daily. This disobedience has only made them take away things that helped me. And the worse my mental state is the more desperate I am to try to bring it up to even the slightest bit. I dont have the strength to tell them how bad Im doing and I cant afford help even if I could get to it. Talking to my friend has helped a lot but Im still getting worse everyday. I feel like Im in quicksand and everything I do to try to get out only makes me sink myself even further down. I dont believe I will survive two more years of this. I wish I had the strength to get help. Im wasting the opportunity for a cheap higher education by tanking my grades because I dont have the energy to do anything.

"I'm a Worthless BastardToday, I really contemplated killing myself. Its not the first time. Ive considered it a lot of times in my life and I always come up with some reason not to. My family needs me too much. Id miss the new episode of my favorite show. For the longest time, the reason I was holding onto was that I didnt want to miss out on Avengers Infinity War and then Endgame. It sounds so stupid now that I think about it. Then I saw it and, even though it wasnt everything I thought it was going to be, I was mostly satisfied, and I forgot. It had been so long that I had forgotten that I was waiting for that movie to end things.

It wasnt until today when I was sitting on the couch, at peace for once. I was genuinely content with myself at that moment. Then my sister came, and she was mad that I didnt take her son to school today. He didnt get a lot of sleep last night, had a really bad nightmare about his grandmother (on his father's side) who had recently passed. I decided to let him stay home since it wouldnt be right to send him to school. My sister confronted me. She accused me of being lazy. She said that all I do is lay around and watch tv all the time. She brought up things; how Id never finished school, how I didnt have a job, how I didnt have any friends, and that the only thing I had in this world was those stupid action figures that I collected. She called me a Worthless Bastard and said that I was going to grow old with nothing and that I better not expect her to take care of me when our mother eventually dies.

A worthless bastard. That really hurt. She thinks that I am a worthless bastard. My own sister. I waited until she left the house and then I cried. I really got to thinking about my life.

She's right. I don't have any friends. I dropped out of college to take care of my mom when she got sick and now I don't have a degree. I'm 23 and still a virgin. I've never even had a boyfriend cause no one ever wanted to ask me out. I was a home care provider for my mom but then I was fired when she changed insurances. No Job. No money. I fill out an application for places and get rejected. I go in for interviews and get rejected. I'm so tired of getting rejected.

I just hate my life. I hate everything about it. Every time I leave the house I just feel like everyone is laughing at me. They can all see how awful I am and are thinking about how much they hate me. I know I'm being irrational. It's just how I feel so I haven't left the house, other than to drop my nephew off at school and pick him up, in days and even then I don't get out of the car that way I don't have to face anyone. I just go home and hide.

I used to be so Smart. I think about how Smart I used to be. I think about my goals. My plans for my life. The things that I wanted to do. I was going to be a doctor. I was going to go to college out of state and It was my plan and Id tell anyone who would listen about my plans.

I endured a lot of bullying growing up and people were always telling me that I was worthless. I was always going to be worthless. I remember in the first grade that I was excluded from games and I didnt have any friends. The Bullying continued throughout Elementary and Middle School. Bullied at school and then bullied at home by my sister and my grandmother. All my life everyone has always told me that I was ugly. that I was stupid. That I was lazy. That I couldn't do anything right. That I was a dumbass. And whenever I'd cry I was called out for being sensitive. Why was I so sensitive? Why couldnt I take a joke?  I was always a target, and there were days when I considered killing myself just for relief. But I didnt. I stood in front of a mirror, tears in my eyes and I said, Not yet. I cant do that to my family.

But I think about it now that Im older. All my life, I was told that I had to take care of my sister. She has a mental disorder and my mom was always telling me that one day when I became a doctor that I had to support my sister. Look after her. I used to have nightmares about that. Nightmares where my mom was a ghost telling me to look after my sister. And after she had my nephew it became, ""Look after both of them.""

Now, I'm nothing. I didn't become anything. I didn't prove anyone wrong. I can't take care of anyone. I'm a waste of space. A worthless Bastard just like she said. I feel so worthless and tired. I hate myself so much. I just wish I was dead.",suicide
"Confusion, suicide and a sick petIve been having a lot of suicidal ideation. Its different this time though because I truly feel Im not meant to be on this plane in existence. I finally realize that waiting out this pain is rather pointless because its going to re-emerge again and whatever contentment I find in the spaces between isnt worth the darkness. I manic-depressive and I cant trust my own brain, my mind. Its the worst its ever been this time.

My cat stopped eating about a week ago. Hes going downhill and the doctors just figured out whats going on but the situation is dire its probably too late. I dont know what to do. Supposedly he has a 79% chance of bouncing back, but in the meantime hes on a feeding tube that I have to tend to every hour and a half. And any other time in my life, I would jump on the chance to help my companion animal get through a hump like this to live. But right now, well Im suicidal, I dont know why am torturing him and torturing me in the process.

The vet said its not torture. That he looks worse than he is. Im not concerned that this vet is bilking me for money, believe me. He really thinks that if we do the tube feeding for about a week that he could be fine for another three, or five, or 10 years. But I dont want to be here another three, or five, or 10 years. I feel horrible that instead of snuggling with me like hes always done, my cat Stays in one spot unless Im coming to feed him and in that case he runs away. Like bolts away for me, running into things along the way because he has the Elizabethan collar on.

I dont know if its good for him or me to keep doing this. I dont know if I put him down, I might come to me angry that I didnt do everything I could. And I dont know if that outweighs the anger Im going to feel if he is deteriorating to a point of no return and his last days with me are horrible. 

I fantasize about killing me and him. Why delay the inevitable? This pain isnt worth it. We could be released from everything.

I'm killing myself tonight because I have literally no reason to be here anymore. I'm fed up with everything, the girl I've known for two years has been a blessing, she's been a crutch for me when I've needed it, she's helped me through everything and I've helped her. 
I've made my share of fuck ups, so of course to her parents I'm the crazy ex who they despise and want nothing to do with.

Yet she's always let me back in, she's always made my heart beat in a way that I never thought it could. She's made the coldest nights warm, and the most painful of injuries turn numb. But she lies. A lot. And I forgive her, I let her in, hell I let her walk all over me but she will suddenly claim one day a week that she wants nothing to do with me. This is how it's always been.

But this week pretty much ended it all for good. Her dad got involved and all kinds of shit (even though we're both 19, yet her parents need to control her life.)

So I'm left here alone, without even the utterance of a goodbye from the woman I've spent the last two years on. Trying to help her beat the battle of depression that I haven't even beaten myself. Tonight the war was lost. I'll send a link of this to her so maybe she can read it. Not that it matters, I've made this up before, but I'm truly going through with it tonight. I'm gonna smoke, then go for a walk, and never look back. Probably won't make it through the night. I love you..if you're reading this.

"Help with SO who is suicidalHi guys, I am in a tough place right now. 

Quick background on me: I have moderate-severe clinical depression. Earlier this year I went to the ER twice for suicidal ideation; before that I had stopped eating and sleeping for three days at a time. I self-harmed every day. My symptoms are *completely managed* by now with meds and therapy and I no longer have suicidal thoughts. 

I just started dating someone (trans nonbinary, assigned female at birth) who has depression and suicidal thoughts that don't enter the planning/methods level of detail, which is good. 

I am struggling because my SO refuses to consider medication for reasons that aren't medically accurate, and relies on me to be their ""antidepressant."" (I make them feel good when we see each other.) Obviously, I understand how awful depression is and knew that going into this relationship, but my SO's refusal to get medical care for their depression/using me to make themselves feel better is really starting to take a toll on my own mental health. 

They got upset at me (over text) when I said I couldn't meet this weekend because I have midterms this next week (I am in a very involved premed program). 

They live about 90 minutes away, so most of our communication is via text/video calls. A couple nights ago we had this exchange: 

SO: I want to die 

me: Do you think you're going to hurt yourself tonight? 

SO: I'm already hurting myself 

me (at this point, shaking because I am upset and afraid they're attempting suicide/self-harming): How? 

SO: I'm trying to write an essay, I can't type both. 

A similar scenario has gone down a couple times; my SO saying they want to die/""end my suffering""/""end me"" and then when I try to figure out what's going on, I'm called a ""nerd"" or told ""stop worrying about me"" (harshly) or even just ignored. One time, they said they wanted to kill themselves, I responded saying something like, there are other ways to make the pain get better, what can I do for you, and was met with ""what are you going to do if I kill myself, spank me?"" 

That message honestly made me sick to my stomach. 

I really care about this person but this is taking a serious toll on me. I understand what it's like to be in that dark, awful place but I feel like I'm being played with, especially with the suicidal comments that, when I inquire about them, I am met with sarcasm or teasing. It is hurting me. I have had the urge to self harm multiple times since I got into this relationship and have had to ban myself from going to certain places where I could obtain the means to do so. 

What should I do, you guys? I dont know what is going on, I dont know if my SO is being serious or messing with me, I dont know how worried I need to be if their thoughts never enter the planning stage, and I dont know if I should stay with them if this continuesnot because they have depression, but because they wont address it, against the advice of numerous medical professionals. 
Weve only been together a month. I really like them and am willing to be there for support, but Im not an antidepressant. Im a person with needs and a history of severe depression. I really dont want to fall back into hurting myself. Please help me figure out how to navigate this.

And yet I know that if I got it, it wouldn't matter because I'll only accept it if it comes from certain people, the ones I seemingly arbitrarily decided to declare ""important"".

I deserve to die and yet I live.  When I'm gone I know no one will mourn the same way for me.

P.S. I want to warn everyone on social media sharing the suicide hotlines and all that about how those hotlines are terrible for helping those in need as most of us have found out. But I don't want to deal with all that.",suicide

"My wife wants a divorce.. 

My wife and I are splitting up. Its because of years of me choosing weed over my family like my sons birthday, my anniversary, all of it... It's all my fault. The women that I spent 5 years of my life married too, had a wonderful unbelievably amazing daughter and son with.. Idk how to do this.

All I want is to kill myself. I don't want to think about.. splitting up material bullshit.. or .. fuck man.. or even how we're suppose to talk to each other now. I'm madly in love with this woman but.. somehow it wasn't enough to overcome my own selfishness. I've ruined the only thing I've ever wanted, a real family. I don't know where I'm suppose to go.. how do I drive now that I'm leaving her with the car, the bills, the kids, my heart, fuck... everything is with this woman. I couldn't stand to see her happy with someone else, but I do wish her nothing but happiness. I just.. she's been kissing me and I was just told its because I want it. She doesn't even want to kiss me. I really fucked up. I don't know where to go from here. I don't know if I want more than what I've already taken in this life. I've struggled with chronic depression and suicidal thoughts my entire life, and right when I think that I'm finally over it.. this happens. I am the bad guy here. I know I am and no matter how many tears I cry it'll never fix what I once had.

If I'm not going to kill myself, then I need to know how to do this. She works 40 hours during the week on days, and I work 2 12's on saturday and sunday so money isn't exactly easy to come by. What about my babies.. how does the mother of my children sustain their living situation and her own without me around to watch them while she works. I'm sure she'll find a way. I'm just really scared.

I've always been depressed for as long as I can remember. This just feels different though. I want it all to stop. I would turn to drugs and alcohol, but I can't even afford those. They only thing keeping me here is my family and girlfriend. If I were to do it, I can't stand to think the hurt they would go through. 

I just don't want to deal with the stress anymore. I want to sit down and not worry about something for one damn minute. I have no sexual urges anymore as a result of anxiety and depression. The outlook for my future is bleak and I feel, hopeless. I have thought of different ways to do it, and I feel like bleeding out is the most sure way and painless.

"It's just one more monthHey,

Was planning to post in /r/depression, but this felt more appropriate.

To sum up, I'm transgender, 20 years old, extremely severe depression, no treatment. Went off one of my anti-depressants a month ago due to side effects, asked my doctors office for an emergency appointment.

Still haven't heard from them. Things are worse than ever. Today I got out of bed, went straight into the bath and fell asleep. Five hours later I got up and went back to bed and slept until my mother got home.

After she walked the dogs, she asked me what I had for lunch. I considered lying, but I didn't have the energy. I told her that I had a piece of old stale bread for lunch, which was the truth. She got angry that I wasn't eating properly, not upset, not sad, angry. She then got angry I didn't empty the dishwasher.

After a while, she came back to my room and told me that she wasn't cooking dinner for me if I stayed in bed. I couldn't bring myself to respond, I just laid there. She's currently eating dinner, and I'm in my room still.

In a month I meet with the trans care people again. This time they might tell me that they've decided to treat me. Probably not though, it's been 2 years and they haven't moved a step in that direction.

I know that I would probably feel better if I actually managed to see my doctor and get another med. I know I probably wouldn't be spending the entire day sleeping and/or thinking about ending it. I can't bring myself to do anything, though. I can't pick up the phone. I can't eat.

They look at me all the time, Ive missed millions of opportunities. But I feel so unable to reach out. Like Im trapped inside myself for having been isolated for so long. 

I hate myself so much. My life is a complete failure. 
Sometimes it occurs to me in a flash that the idea of ending my life is an aberration as the gift of life is such a sacred and gorgeous thing, and I mean I really feel it in a deep way. 
Also Im fully aware of my potential (which is in part why I despise myself so much). But in moments like now (and theyre getting more and more frequent and intense) all I can think of is my pain. 

The lack of socializing, physical affection and sex leads to a very real physical pain at this point. I feel it all over my body. Like a wave that envelopes me and ends up focusing right in my heart, like a frozen fist clenching suddenly around it. 

And believe me Im not letting myself go. Im fighting with all I got. Ive quit smoking (both cigarettes and weed), stopped fapping and watching porn, I exercize daily, meditate, take cold showers, go for walks, got back to photography, which was a big hobby of mine, and started seeing a therapist. 

But no matter the efforts and although Im getting positive results in some regards, the loneliness is just too fuckin unbearable. 
And everyday, little by little, Im losing my will to live. I end up crying in my bed almost every night. ",suicide

I highly doubt that though.

My mother has verbally abused me (and almost physically) since I was a young teen, about 13-14 years old. Ever since I was that age she has been constantly talking about financial issues, my Dad, our broken family, negative complaints about herself hating life and other bad toxic things, basically manipulating my train of thought all this time and self-esteem.

I feel like an alien among other people my age because I have grown up so sheltered and uneducated. I feel like I'm wasting my time and there's nothing out there for me.

Add to that my family always being assholes to me because they think I'm crazy.  I also bottle up all the things about them that hurt me and drink to feel better, then eventually tell them off.

My brother beat my face for a solid 3 minutes, twice within 15 minutes, for saying shot that was true but he didn't like.  That was the day before Thanksgiving 2017.  I spent the next three days in bed thinking of how I was going to kill myself.  Nobody checked on me.

Now my mother and niece physically attacked me the other day, stole my phone and hid my car key.  I lost my job.  They think I'm making up what happens to me and the only thing really wrong with me is the drinking.

I've fucked up everything so badly there's no hope in fix it. Time is an illusion. Life has no meaning. I've been battling my own death for 3 years. I'm a mistake. I'm a cosmic joke. I'm asexual. I can't do anything right. I'm non-binary agender. I can't do anything right. I'm bad and I know it's true. People try to help me an I push them away. I don't deserve your energy, because I'm a black hole. I'm tired all the time. I'm 19 and I failed my first year of college because I couldn't even get out of bed in the morning. Now I have debt. I have no job because I'm afraid of failing at that too. If I get a job and it goes horribly like everything else I wouldn't survive it. It's  lose-lose situation. I FAILED. It's over. People trusted in me. People believed in me. And I FAILED. I'm a speck, on a smudge, on a particle, on a grain of sand, on a beach, among billions of beaches, so what does anything matter anyway. I'm done. I wish I'd never been conceived. I'm gonna fix that mistake. Fuck this reality. I hope it was all a simulation, because then it might make sense why my life has been such a sick cosmic joke. Goodbye everyone who knew me, but never knew me. You know nothing about me, and maybe that's all by design. This is it for me. I've had the rope for years. I'm done. Life is suffering. I'm killing myself. It's finally happening.",suicide

"Fuck this life. Fuck trying. Created this account just to say goodbye.Long time redditor, and lurker in suicide watch.  I attempted suicide last year, pretty close to this time.  Thought my life was falling apart...ha!  I had no idea how bad it could get.

I'm about to be evicted.  I've lost out on two good paying jobs now.  My girlfriend lives in another state, and is struggling hardcore herself...and I can't even support her.

I have no family here.  I have no family within 2000 miles.  My ex wife won't even check on the kids, let alone give me child support.  she's too busy snorting her money up her nose.

"I can't go on any longerI'm so sick of this, so fucking sick of this. I actually hated my therapist and forced myself to see her because I'd get my medication and let it do its job. Stopped seeing her, I'll take someone else. She was cold and I felt like she really didn't give a fuck. I'll call my family doctor to see if he can prescribe me some stuff, because I had to stop my treatment. Ran out of pills.

So many bottled up feelings inside of me. I want to put them out, ALL of them. I feel like I'm falling apart day by day, my creativity is blocked despite having plenty of ideas, I just can't get to do them. I can't confess to my best friend because I'm afraid I might lose her friendship, especially since she's got a boyfriend. I left many of my old friends because those assholes left me right when I needed them, and despite talking it out with them, I can't fucking go back to them like I used to. I met new people, but I can't get myself to truly go towards them. I don't want this anymore. I don't want to trust people, and have them care more about the death of a fucking idol than about their depressed friend. 

The true reason why I'm currently seeing family is that I don't want to be alone. I'm afraid I might do something stupid if I stay in my dorm room. I just want someone to hold me and tell me it's okay. Let me cry in their arms. Listen to me. I can't show this part of myself to people because depressed people like me become a huge pressure. They usually leave right after. One of my friends did, and it was the last time I came close to suicide.

"I'm Done [m16]I've recently returned from a certain summer camp (which will remain unnamed so I don't end up hunted down and thrown in a padded room) and it was a generally good if not underwhelming experience, but it was the only thing I've cared about for the past year. Without that to look forward to my life is back to its typical aimlessness. I'm back to hating everybody I talk to and feeling only fleeting instances of an emotion that could only loosely be described as positive.

I hate thinking this way but sometimes I just wished I could be knocked down by a car or contract a life-threatening illness, basically cease to exist. I feel as if I'm a failed person/adult, who never really grew up or matured as everyone else did. I'm way behind my peers in terms of career, socializing and life in general. I lack confidence in everything I do, even in simple basic things. I don't understand how this life works and I feel like I never will. And I know that it won't make a difference to the world if I wasn't here anyway, their lives would probably be better off without the burden and trouble that is me.",suicide
"My friend told me she made a suicide noteMy friend had attempted suicide thrice this year.  I'm practically 1000 miles away from her and I can't go there to make sure that everything's OK.  I'm scared that after telling me her about her suicide note, she'll feel more compelled to carry it out. She's been my support system when I hit rock bottom and a reason for me to keep trying on living. I really don't know what I'll do if she dies. 

I don't know how to tell her she's a strong and beautiful person, that she's worth it, that I love her no matter how bad things get. It's hard to voice them out in messages and not sound like I'm just telling those as some other feel good compliments and I don't mean any of it. I can't make her call the national hotline because she absolutely hates making a phone call when she's crying, I can't force her to see a psychologist or go to a hospital because she couldn't afford it and I'm only making things worse to her financially.

"My therapist cut me off and its got me suicidalI was seeing her pretty consistently this whole year, and Ive been doing very intense work on my trauma.  However, I had a habit of not showing up to sessions sometimes due to my depression.  This whole year I was going consistently, and its helped a lot. 
In the past three weeks, I did not show up because my depression was going off the rails, and I had no energy. 

I was attempting to reach her the past few days to set up an appointment, and she finally got back to me telling me that shes going to have to stop seeing me due to my inconsistency. 

Im really crushed and just broken down because of this.  My suicidal thoughts and ideations have been increasing in intensity the past three months, but now I would say Im at a 9.2/10 in terms of wanting to end it.

"No sleep in 4 days. Can't win. Can't not lose.I started coughing 4 days ago and haven't stopped.  Can't sleep, can't lie down, can't walk any distance at any pace, can only sit if I'm hunched over like a cocktail shrimp, and that only delays the coughing for about half an hour.  

Full throated coughing, abs spasming with pain, coughing so much it feels like I'm bleeding, coughing so much I throw up.  Went to the ER, got a fistful of scrips, got released at 11:00 pm.

"I'm only 20 years old but I constantly think about the process of ageingSorry if this is too long.

I'm ""only"" (""only"" according to what people say) 20 years old, and even though I wouldn't say I feel ""old"" exactly, I'm always thinking about our finite youth, about ageing and our mortality. I can't get it out of my head.

A new song from a band I like comes out and I realise they're 33, and I immediately start imagining myself in their shoes, as a 30 year old, with a lot of nostalgia of the past and thinking about my past and my past mistakes. I'm inevitably miserable in these pictures.

I see people I like, admire or love age and that induces me into a profound existential crises. I'm **extremely** scared of ageing, you probably have no idea how much it scares and paralyses me. I'm scared of regrets, I'm scared of ending up a nobody, I'm scared of working a job I hate and that drains me emotionally.

I can't stop thinking about my past regrets and worrying about doing things now that I will regret in the future. I feel so much guilt when I'm not 100% efficient in what I'm doing. I feel so bad about myself, my laziness and my inability to spend long hours focused and studying. I guess I hate myself for allowing myself to get defeated so easily by difficulty, I hate myself for being too weak. I really REALLY want this thing but I'm so fucking lazy and when things get difficult I just can't pull through. I want it so much that I want to cry. It's more like a necessity than a mere desire.

The idea of having obtained this dream of mine is super motivating, but having to do the work exhausts me *emotionally*. I know at least one of the reasons why this happens (meaning perhaps there are others), but I'm too embarrassed to tell anyone, let alone publicly. The past month when mom came to visit me and help me with my breakdown, with difficulty I partially told her my ""dream"", why I want it, and why it's so important to me, and why working hard to achieve itself is so painful.

It's not a crime or anything like that, but it's something I feel is ridiculous and laughable, something silly and that demonstrates how weak I am (or have become).

One of my fears is *having* to commit suicide in the future (between 2 and 4 years from now) due to an unbearable amount of regret and guilt. I *know* I won't find any other solution but to commit suicide if I don't achieve my dream at least partially or if I don't achieve it in the time period I *need* to. This is because my goal heavily depends on my age, and it has nothing to do with a decline in my capacities or anything like that. My goal is along the lines of ""enjoy your young years doing things that 20 years olds are"". Time itself is part of the ""specifications"" of my goal.

30 year olds or late 20 year olds hanging out with early 20 year olds is weird and unacceptable, and I wouldn't feel part of the group either. I want to hang out with 20 year olds AS a 20 year old, but right now I can't. I've already wasted so much time isolating myself for 6 years in my room with my computer, not hanging out with people my age, not gaining experiences, not making memories, but now what I want is something slightly different. And being so ""ambitious"" or ""demanding"" sometimes makes me feel bad too. Perhaps I'm just a spoiled kid who hasn't grown up yet and learned of life.

Maybe I have to stop being so stubborn and unreasonable, make peace with a life without this delusional, grandeur dream of mine, and live peacefully where I am. I know progress can't be accelerated so much, I do know it, but I so wish it could, you don't know much this pains me. Life is so painful, ageing is so painful, your face changing and getting more 30-year-old-looking is so painful. I want to stay this age forever, hang out with people my age all over the world, celebrate with them, suffer with them, talk with them, know of their dreams and fears, learn about their subcultures, be part of the group, etc.

That last sentence is an exaggerated and less specific version of what I actually want, but yea, as you see, it's kind of stupid.",suicide

I said things on Facebook, mentioned her having an abortion, contacted her friends, and generally became pretty creepy about the whole thing. 

      Not a day goes by where I wouldn't give anything just for her to speak to me, even to call me the shithead I am. She wont , not one word in five years, can't blame her.

Now, I am afraid to even find anyone else, I feel tainted and unworthy. 

I have avoided doing well in school or work my entire life, I have a pretty decent IQ but all that does is give me fucked up thoughts of despair and meaninglessness. 

I suck at writing. 

When I'm happy people want to be near me, but I never am. I spend my days smoking pot, caring for my ailing father, mother, and a kid they adopted for whatever reason. I can't even kill myself because if I did she goes to cps and gets placed in foster care. I like her enough and she's a good kid. I just can't do it. I am not up to this task.

My health is failing me in multiple ways. Developed allergies to wheat, tomatoes, fruits, rice, onions.....lots of plants. All I can eat is corn, oats, meat and potatoes, as far as I can tell. It isn't the type of allergy that will kill me either, imagine rolling around in fiberglass and feeling that way for two days or so after anything on the bad list. It sucks I hate it. I get frequent headaches and always think I'm dying, but I really do feel like shit except no one believes it, they think I'm nuts, again I can't blame them. A lot more but I'm tired of writing.

Just looked at the ex's FB pic, she is beautiful as ever. I hope her life is happy. I know I could never have brought it to her. I bet she isn't alone today.

Im still not over being in an abusive relationship 2+ years ago. And my most recent ex didn't take me seriously because I was in an abusive relationship, so that opened old wounds.

"I'm mentally deficient and I refuse to live with it.Hi, I'm Steve. I'm 17, I live with autism and mental deficiencies, and I'm going to kill myself right after I submit this god damn post.

I'm not posting this because I want help. I'm posting this because these words need to go somewhere, and honestly I don't know of a better place where a message like this would be acceptable.

Back to the subject. I'm autistic, and I have some really bad mental deficiencies and it's fucking killing me on the inside. I took a cognitive test when I was 15. I have an IQ of 77, and I was ranked either ""Deficient"" or ""Borderline Deficient"" on everything. Fuck. It's so hard living with the fact that your limits are so fucking low compared to the rest of the general population and you will never fucking be able to achieve your dreams because of some bullshit that I can't fucking help.

I'm in the special education program at my school and I fucking hate it. They teach jack shit and group me with kids that screech and shit their pants. I can talk normally, I just don't want to unless I'm asked. I'm mentally fucking deficient but I want to be taught something that's above preschool level. I've tried telling my mom it's not enough for me but she just dismisses me and tells me I won't make it in mainstream education. I try telling my special ed teachers I want more, but they dismiss me too and then make jokes about me behind my back like I can't fucking hear them. Hey, Mr. Janssen, when you read this, fuck you. I heard every little bit of shit you talked about me. Mrs. Huang, fuck you. I heard you call me inbred. Ms. Baker, fuck you too. I get it, I'm not smart and I never fucking will be but I want to be taught more than fucking preschool shit. Fuck.

I'll say it again: you have no fucking clue how hard it is to live when you know that your limits are much much lower than the average person, you will never graduate high school, you will never go to college, and you will never get any respectable job, and generally your life will be very unfulfilling. I always dreamed of being a coder, but guess what? That requires you to be smart and guess who isn't smart? Me. I tried to teach myself. It doesn't click and while I love it I'm so fucking bad and it takes me hours to figure out things that are ""super basic"". I can't do it. It's too hard.

I'm not willing to live a life in which I can't be a normal person. I just want to graduate high school, go to college, get a good job, and just have a normal life. But all of that has been made inaccessible by the fact that I'm in fucking special ed and won't even graduate high school and will forever be dependent on my parents.

I don't want to burden my parents any more by being the dead weight piece of shit that I am. And I don't want to doom myself to a life of suffering.

I hope you all can now sympathize with me.

Goodbye.",suicide

"The bare-minimum lifeDon't leave the house. Don't talk to anyone. Don't take care of yourself, or the place you live in (at least to an acceptable level). Cry at everything, or be unable to summon the tears when you need them. Spend all your time in escapism. Lose touch with reality. Forget how you used to be. Partake in all of the self-damaging behaviours. Quit them, just to swap to another and cycle back again in a few months. Your old friends hate you. Your family blames you for everything. Every single day seems wasted and is all too painful.

This is not a call out to anyone, or a guide or pity party, I am looking at my own dogshit life and crying. This is what I have reduced myself to, through my own faults and actions (or lack thereof), and my illnesses. 

The pain is so horrible that self-immolation seems like an okay option right now. 

But seriously, it does not seem like I can get off this ride anymore. It's full steam ahead to a bottomless pit of suffering unless I throw myself off. I'm at a loss and like many other people, I am lonely and alone. Honestly I don't know, or understand, who would choose life.",suicide

"I just called a crysis hotline, what a waste of time and tearsI don't want to make a new reddit account because I tried to last time I wanted to post and ended locked out of the site and it was just a nightmare.

so ya don't wreck my life and find out who i am. 

I just called a crysis hotline, and it was busy, lol and I called 5 more times and it was busy twice and then it rang and I hung up and then I called twice more and it was busy both times. then I found another line for some local crysis centre.

i used to work as a telephone surveyer, it was like someone trying to sell me a long distance plan over the phone, just keep me on the line and keep trying to make the crysis center upsell. special one time offer! how about we send a mobile crysis unit and they come talk to you.

actually that sounds terrible, I just wanted to talk to somebody about my problems because my doctor can't see me till feburary and I have no friends and my parents are a large part of the problem. so basically I am alone, I am completely and utterly alone and nobody really cares.

it's all up to you she says, wow what a thing to say to someone with depression, yes I know all my lifes decisions have been made by me, i know that my life is either shitty or it isn't based off my actions. I very much know that. why would I be depressed if I didn't blame myself? just fucking terrible, now I'm just drainned and sorta just pissed off instead of suicidal.

it's like the only support they will offer is putting you in a halfway house... well I work fulltime so that's not gonna work, and I don't have vacation days, and I work nights, so one of the things they do there is get you on a routine and give you support classes and whatever. well that's not really gonna work if I get up at 8-10pm and go to bed at noon-2pm

so basically the only support society has to offer is completely fucking up my life, I actually don't mind my job, I actually like it there, it's the one safe spot in the world is work. I live at home and I live my parents who raised very very fat, I was obese by kindergarden and I have been since. but I know it's not there fault because we are all only to blame ourselves for our problems. then I tried to start losing the weight and I almost lost it all, and then it's just they leave open bags of chips and cookies and chocolauts and just the most unhealthy high calorie garbage all over the house, but why don't I just move out? well because I tried to start a business with my credit and it didn't work out and now my current job barely pays off my loan payments and I've maxed out my credit cards paying them rent(which they feel they rightously deserve and are the greatest parents they know in their lives for not just telling me to get the fuck out.) I didn't even ask them to change their habits, I just asked for them not to leave junk out where I can see it. this was responded to in a way I only decribe by saying. have you ever tried to take food away from an aggressive dog? and they growl at you just completely almost out of charecter, just an instintive aggressive violent response with no reason or consideration.

so now I'm stuck and I really wanna kill myself just because I know they will get stuck with my debt. I'm not even hopelessly in debt, I just can't leave here, but I can't live being this fat anymore, because nobody will love me, or even even affectionitly touch me, I don't even mean sex, I just me anything not out of sympathy or pity from a female. you know I don't even blame them for regecting me anymore, they all actually out of their way nice to me

so ya whatever I guess, I'm taking some art classes, and I found out I'm very talented, lol I'm a very honest person in a way that's great on camera. But I'm fat and people don't have sympathy for fat people(well unless there in the process of asking forgiveness and making claims of future weight loss) if you just try to put them in a normal life situation, people inheritly react negatively, because fat people are ugly, I think it too

but ya I can't fix it. I know people won't accept this statement, but when I'm on my ""healthy diet"" I feel great and am not hungry because it's well balanced and not extremely low calorie. But I come home from work and it's just there is food and sugar everywhere, and as soon I get eating it, I want more and then i don't care because I think I've already fucked it up for myself, I might as well just eat more so I don't feel bad.

and then i feel great for a little while and then I crash off the sugar and I feel terrible, I feel god awful I feel doing nothing in the world that won't seem like unenjoyable effort. and I just think about how bad I feel and how much I don't want to feel that way anymore and how much I wish i could just do something that would make me feel better. so I get in my car and I drive to one of the oh so many mcdonalds and I get 3 double cheeseburgers and each has 400 calories, that's 1200 calories I can eat in I dunno. 4 stop lights away from the mcdonalds. and that like more than half of my total daily calorie needs. on top of the regular diet which is about 500 under my daily needs and the fucking near thousand calories of just junk food my parents leave around. then all of a sudden I'm like 2000 calories over my needs and then that's evey day, and that's like all in the last 3-4 hours of the day. and the next day maybe I just don't care anymore and instead of coffee or diet coke in the morning for caffiene maybe I go and get two 400 calorie energy drinks. and the high is so good and the crash is so hard and I eat a couple more thousand calories of junk when I get home and feel terrible from crash.

 it's just I meet people and I fall in love with them and I can see they care about me, they go out of there way to be nice to me because they see how down I get on myself. but if I ever try to just anything, just any interaction beyond this totally not out of your way interaction. I know we're in a art class and you say things to me that let me know you don't hate me, because I act like I think you hate me, but it's not because you hate me, it's because I love(yes I know I don't know what the word means but I like to use it) you and you'll regect me and it's easier for me to perceive it as hate, and you go out of your way to say it isn't and you care that little bit. and I think why did she say that and you think maybe she likes me and it's just this natural reaction and attraction, no desperation, there isn't time to get desperate and you just say ""I'm gonna play it cool and later maybe do something."" and then you get home and you remember, I'm almost 300 pounds and she was just being nice and if I you even tried to talk to her directly outside of what the art deems nessisary she'll regect you like everyone else because you've done that, that same thing has happend dozens of times and you've played it out like groundhogs day, where you've done every possible thing, reacted everyway, tried everything(including not trying) and it has all ended the same.

you know the worst part lately is I started going to the gym 2 years ago and I'm actually in pretty good shape, I'm just really really fat, I lifting and flexibility and I cycle(even though it's really hard being so fat). and I got down to I'm 6'2 220 which the lightest I've been in ever,  even as a kid I always had a higher body fat percentage, the first time I've been under 30bmi since I've remember checking my weight. and now in 5 months I've thrown away all of it and gained 50lbs and I remember how hard it was to lose, and I remember I had all the advantages of starting something new and being excited about my new diet and just being able to ignore the junk food(mostly it was always an  issue, always adding a few hundred calories here and there). and now it's like you can sell everything you own, get your debt to a controlable level and move out, but I have to move walking distance from work, because i bought a car when I was younger and I broke down and I lost my entire investment and my oh so generous and horribly unappreciated parents let me drive one there 4 vechiles to work, after they moved and took me with them, it was a mistake to move out with them, but I would have no car and I couldn't take my art classes, or even have access to a gym because there isn't one around my work where I would have to move to and only be able to walk because there is no public transportation around there.

so ya I was looking for place in the river to jump in(thin ice around some shores), and I'm not tryhing to violate the rules,  it's just it seemed like a good idea, I was just gonna jump and swim to shore(if I could make it) and that seemed like a good idea. then just go to the emergency room and cry and they would have to something, I dunno, it seemed lik,e the only way to get any attention to my suffering without having to get in a confrontation with someone. but whatever I'm really tired now and I just want someone I dunno. there is nothing I know nobody can help me, the things I want that will make me happy I can't ask and don't have any right to ask. but crying makes me tried and I don't like having to hear myself, crying wouldn't be so bad if I didn't have to hear the whale, it's like someone else, it's like I'm hearing some other person in the most heart breaking hopeless disappar and it frightens me.  I'm just thinking wrong, reacting wrong, I just don't interpet the world correctly and everything that makes me meserable is all in my head and is all just a chosen personality flaw that I need to get over, or go to therapy for.

and all of this will start over again tomorrow, but it'll be friday so I can play video games on the weekend and maybe I'll get some mcdonalds and a big sugar slurpee and I'll be happy, that's what I have to look forward to. the only thing good in my life is the thing that makes so terrible.",suicide

"My mom is a shopaholic and I'm so over it. I didn't know what else to call her besides shopaholic, she doesn't go shopping for random things. She buys specific things and her latest kick is Starbucks cups. I absolutely despise it because she'll complain about not having enough money for important things, like my braces or food, but will then go onto facebook and buy a bunch of cups that are around $100-$50. It may be even more than that but that's just what I've seen. I've been alive for a phase like that where she would buy leggings from lula roe. She only stopped because it turned out to be a pyramid scheme. She's also done the same thing other times like buy beanie babies but I wasn't alive at the time. I think she only does it to deal with stress, but even if that is the reason she has to find something else to release her stress and it shouldn't be berating me or my sisters either. This whole thing just reminds me of how much I dislike my mother because of how horrible she is, I would get into it but this post is just mostly about how annoyed I am and stressed out I am that's shes wasting all this money on cups she'll never use. My family has thought of doing an intervention but we never act on it because we know she'll never listen and just pretend to be the victim.

"Lost my job this morningSorry in advance for my lack of cohesion and my stream-of-consciousness way of writing this all down. 

I was fired from my job in customer service this morning, an all-time low. I couldn't stand waiting for rude people to call me while sitting in front of my computer for 8 hours a day and it has been depressing me terribly this past year (only been working in cs for a year). Maybe part paranoia, but I felt like it was treated like the lowest position in the company (SaaS type company, ~100 employees) and frankly I was embarrassed of it. I hated every day and although I'm not dumb enough to ever quit a decently paying job, I'm ostensibly not above being largely inconsistent in my work there due to my internal struggle with where I am as a 30 year old. I hated it and couldn't ever keep up a charade for long. 

Full disclosure, I've had suicidal ideation for approximately 15 years. I survived an attempt when I was 14 and professionals will tell you it's increasingly common for repeat attempts to occur in the wake of the attempt. In spite of all of this - I've beat the odds, graduated college, landed a pretty great job with my degree in 2011 but screwed it up and ended up being fired after a year and a half. I was out of my league (not really an unexpected thing when post-college) but my pretty rigid defense mechanism that I've had these past 15 years caught up with me. I have a propensity the be highly critical of those around me, as well as myself. I can do a 180 at the drop of a dime on how I feel about someone. I guess you could say I'm a pretty emotional little guy, internally.

My parents divorcing after around 34 years have contributed to my emotional state, this happened maybe 2 years ago. I was very much in the middle of it and they both ended up being (what I consider to be) immature, dishonest and manipulative towards me. At the end of it all, they both moved out of state. My family outside of them has been pretty much zero, partially my fault (embarrassment after my attempt, too). Suffice to say, Christmases throughout high school consisted of just them and me and sometimes my one sister (whom ran away at the age of 17 to be with her current husband).

Also of note, my parents were rich growing up, and you could probably say I had a silver spoon in my mouth for most of my life. MANY extravagant vacations when I was young and pretty much through college. I've seen a lot of very beautiful things and had it very easy for a lot of my life. Which is why I'm even more willing to let go of all of this. My life isn't going to get any better and I don't mean to drone on too much with my narcissism but I've just had it. I've had a lot of great memories that I'm able to smile about. I've been fortunate enough to fall head over heels in love with and date a girl during 3 years of college so at least I know I've truly lived. I just don't ever want to make the mistake of having children that have this same depressive affinity that I do. 

These last 15 years have been so volatile for me, I don't think I'll be able to do another 15. It's most assuredly fucked up how often I think of suicide, I know that. But I've survived 15 years feeling this way... 15 years of introspectively daydreaming of suicide....as an easy out type fantasy, as a realistic look of the world and it's brevity...my brevity.

I just want advice. I've done therapy and it opens pandora's box. I tried celexa for a year, two years back, and it turned me into a hypermanic mess.

The only thing that makes me happy is music. I can sit at a piano and improvise beautiful compositions off the cuff. It's catharsis for me to stave my loneliness at times. Sometimes I'll play for an hour straight, and just start crying midway because of how much I keep inside. It does help, though.

"Why do people put on the sarcastic voice? Adding tone to sarcasm sucks all the dryness out of it. For example, if you had a resting neutral face and said ""Wow, that's amazing. I'm ecstatic.""

"19, Queer, and pointlessI've been struggling with these thoughts since middle school and each year they only seem to get worse. Ever since I've realised how pointless I was compared to my peers they've permeated in my head. I've always been the outcast amongst people and groups of friends. I'm never the one that gets invited to parties or to hangout and they're all busy when I ask them to without fail. High school was a period of constant put downs and anxiety. I hadn't realised I was gender queer at the time which greatly harmed my sense of self identity and my ability to present who I was to others. Because of this I've been particularly social awkward and anxious. College was where things were supposed to change. New faces and new resources. Things almost immediately went to shit. I could get myself to classes or meet people outside of my hall. When I finally realised I was gender queer I felt/feel like a freak. Being a nonbinary AMAB means receivimg a fraction of a percent of the acceptedness and support your binary AMAB peers receive. I've  tried attending GSA meetings but I've only been treated as even more of an outsider since I don't fit their concepts of queerness. Spring semester and this semester have just been repeats of the same. Combine this with potential financial and roommate issues and I feel like my time is coming to it's end. I can't put my parents through the embarrassment of having a trans child that also dropped out of school and the stress of academics is tearing me apart physically and mentally. This summer I had the opportunity to throw myself off the dam near my college. I sat there at the top for nearly 4 hours. It would've looked like a fishing accident and saved my family so much embarrassment from my failures. I wish I would have done it. Now the plan is to intentially crash my car into a tree on a particularly rainy night so it looks like an accident. Until then I'll pretend everything is fine. My name is Zairen and I use they/them pronouns. I'm a 2nd year Csci student, a DJ Training Director, and my time is coming to an end.",suicide

"I'm a broken, unlovable person.I found out today I lost a friend because they had romantic feelings for me. I'm devastated to say the least. But I came to the realisation that im a broken, unlovable person. I have severe trust issues, I cannot ever get into a romantic relationship because I just cannot trust. I will fear they will leave or cheat on me. Now I'm second guessing all of my friendships. Maybe they don't really like me. Maybe they'll break up with me, and im just a lamb waiting to be slaughtered. 

I will never find someone. I just cannot. Not even a friendship, they always fail. I don't know what's wrong with me. I just keep getting hurt.

"Pushed to the edge and trying to find hopeI havent made a post like this before, but have reached out in the past with career guidance and the such. Right now, Im not doing well and Im in a really low place and am trying to find some outlet that wont scare and worry my friends and family.

Ive hit a breaking point and new rock bottom in the last 7 years of depression and anxiety (now knowing it as bipolar disorder with a recent diagnosis) one month ago. My post isnt a full as synopsis of everything and can never really be in a short post and may jump around.

My now ex girlfriend and I had dated exactly one year when she told me she emotionally cheated on me for three months with one of her coworkers and made out with him when they got drunk one night. Now, Some of my best friends got married  this week where my ex was the maid of honor. I had a conversation with my ex before the wedding letting her know I wanted to be friends still and to get anything that might set either of us off out of the way for our friends to have their day.  (many advise no on the friends with the ex, especially in this situation, but I still care about her as a person and know she is a good person that has fucked up). I miss my relationship more than I miss her as a romantic partner, and just want my friendship that I have/had with her to remain. I dont have many friends left around me. 

The night before their wedding, I got a text from my sister saying my dad had gone to the hospital and didnt say much more than that. My sisters and my parents are the only blood family I have that cares anything for me, and my parents had stopped talking to me since my recent diagnosis of Bi-Polar disorder. (They dont understand it, and Dont believe I am and think Im chasing something that doesnt exists) . The next morning I tried to prop myself up for my friends wedding, being happy for them and trying to forget my problems to be able to. But I wasnt able to.

I feel so guilty and ashamed of myself, but After drinking a little much I pushed my ex too far asking if she still wanted to be friends and if she was ok at the celebration after their wedding. (Beating the dead horse as we both promised not to do) And told her I dont think being friends will ever work. I knew I fucked up immediately and left the wedding and drove home. I abandoned and ran away from all the family I had at their wedding. (My friends and fraternity brothers). 

All this is too much for me right now; with the added fact Ive changed myself for other people to please and keep them around like my ex and family. I also followed my ex to an area and got a job that I dont find meaningful or fulfilling. And the fact I lost all sense of accomplishment and fulfillment in activities I used to love. I lead myself down a self destructive trail in the pursuit of what I thought would make me whole. I know now that its a problem I need to work on.

Ive sent an apology to my ex and my friends today to try to mend things a little. I dont know how they feel, but I can imagine it hurts, is frustrating and an annoyance they didnt need. 

I promised everyone around me I would never kill myself, That it would magnify the pain Im feeling and put it on to them. Im just so unstable right now even on medication, therapy, and exercise. I know I can reach out to my friends for support and dont want to burden them. Im just so afraid, and lonely right now. I dont want to die, but death is looking more and more favorable. I just want the unnecessary guilt and pain to go away. 

To anyone that reads this, thank you.",suicide

"My step father is repeatedly telling me that he's going to divorce my mother because of him having to provide for me. I feel like suicide is the only option as I can't support her or myself.I suffer from severe depression and anxiety among other problems that I'd rather not go into detail about that prevents me from functioning in nearly any social circumstance, and my family has been in poverty for a long time. I've tried to get a job several times only to not be considered after an interview on the phone or otherwise.

Understandably, my parents and step dad find this hard to bear. My mom is sad over my condition but handles it. The fact of that matter is that, I'm a leech. On society, but mostly for my parents which work to support me.

Recently, my step-dad has been threatening me, personally, with divorce (divorcing my mom, so to speak).

He makes it expressly clear that it is MY fault, and my fault alone. While my mom is less confrontational, she's essentially said similar things to me i.e. ""Me and X will divorce only because of you""

I've had suicidal thoughts for a long time now, but have always been grounded by the belief that there were people around me who loved me.

Except now everyobdy is sick. My dad is threatening to leave my Mom because of me, ruining her financially for the rest of her life, putting her in a cardboard box hungry on the streets of some city as a homeless 60 year old woman, my girlfriend routinely reminds me that she hates me and wants me to die, my Mom cries and has stress induced back pain every night. I can hear her crying through the wall.

I am causing their lives to fall apart. And I don't know what do. ""Get a job"", ""Put soem effort into it"", ""Fix your life"". Well drugs aren't fixing it, motivation isn't fixing it, discipline isn't fixing it.

I have no drive, I have no use, I make life worse for everybody around me, and I'm a leech financially. 

I just want to die. It's not selfish anymore. IT's not petty. If I die now, I can break my Moms heart, but I can save her financial future. A mentally broken hobo is worse than a heartbroken woman that is being provided her. A girl with baggage is better than a girl who is with somebody she despises. A guy is better off working one job instead of two to support a disabled fuckwit.

I'm just desperately hoping for a branch to fall onto.

Life would be so great if I could make all my problems go away, but, as everyone knows, life is not that simple. So I want to die. I don't want to face my problems. 

My life is going nowhere. I'm a bad person. Every waking moment when I'm not distracting myself with Reddit or video games, I am wishing I was dead. I hate myself so much. I wish I never existed. I don't want to live my life anymore because it's fucking terrible.

Not only that, but  I plan to take AP Bio next year, which would require me to drop my favorite class, choir. Choir is really important to me and I'm very close with everyone there. I was originally planning to take English 3 over summer school, but now I'm not sure since I might take AP Lang.

I should also mention that I had an awful teacher for English in freshman year. I mean, she made me hate English and breakdown multiple times. She's also one of few AP Lang teachers.

Wow, lengthy. Sorry. Should I take English 3 over summer school for less stress and the ability to keep my favorite class, or should I drop choir and just suffer through AP Lang?

I'm so mad at myself that I got myself into such an awful situation, and I'm broken hearted that no one else I the apt will even try to get his resolved, so I'm going to have to get my roommates evicted or something instead of kindly letting them or me leave.

My hand is infected from trying to protect cats, and the antibiotics aren't working, and I can't find my cream and that makes me paranoid about all of this.

"Week 1 of grad school and I'm already a failureI started grad school last week. I was so excited and prepared, already having chapter 1 of each textbook read and detailed notes in my notebook. While I anticipated grad school to be challenging, especially when I work a full time job, I did not expect this quarantine to make things 200x harder.

I thought working as a kindergarten teacher from home would allow me more free time after work to focus on my classes. Instead, I'm being buried in emails from school directors and from parents. I have to send 36 emails every Monday with homework packets, in addition to making 36 phone calls every day to check in on parents and log their feedback onto an excel spreadsheet for the school directors to see. I also have to make PowerPoints and lesson plans daily, and teach live zoom classes spread out throughout each day, along with attending morning teacher meetings.

With all this extra work and stress of parent complaints (because of course they are NEVER satisfied with the work we're putting in for their kids), my anxiety has been through the roof. This has made it extremely difficult for me to focus on my schoolwork, as I'm constantly exhausted and feel too anxious about my work not being good enough, so I've struggled to make it through my discussion board posts and short papers. I procrastinated because I'm a fucking dumbass, and get too stuck in my own head and anxiety over not being smart enough for grad school. Because of this, I waited til the last minute to type my paper and wound up turning it in at 12:31am. It had been due at 11:59pm. I had no idea that, even though all the discussion posts and replies I posted were on time (days before the deadline; I *only* procrastinated the paper bc I was so stupidly scared of doing a shit job), failure to turn in this paper would result in automatic withdrawal from the class. My other online class is fine, I have an A. But now thats my only class, which means its going to take me even longer to graduate and I'm going to be a fucking underpaid kindergarten teacher forever. I'm never going to get my PsyD because I'm a fucking moron who can't manage her time and swallow her stupid fucking mental issues for important shit like this. Its almost 5am and I've been trying to calm myself down for the past 2 hours; I finally found this place to vent to. I hope that's okay. My cat is with me so I'm not going to hurt myself.

"Watching myself slowly die.I'm not even sure what to do anymore.  This isn't me.  This isn't my life.  I stopped taking my meds today.  I don't want to get better anymore.  What was I even trying for to begin with?

Im only 27 and I married the wrong man.  I dont love him.  We are not compatible.  I tried to leave him before and start a new, but he tried to kill himself and begged to come back.  I cut off all ties but he found me anyway.  I took him back and it was the biggest mistake of my life.  Now were married.  I refuse to procreate with him.  Im not dragging other human life into my misery.  He says he loves me and he cares, but his insecurities and esteem make it impossible for us to coexist.

His debt is following me.  They found my number.  Collectors call every day.  I answered the call one time because I did not realize that it was a collector.  My husband became extremely upset with me for answering the call.  He said that I made everything worse because they know how to contact us now.  I dont answer my phone at all anymore.  He owes tens of thousands for student loans and he is pretending like they dont exist.  He gets angry at me when I try to help.  Ive given up on the subject.

"Hmm. I can't think of a good title that isn't generic. I'll say it's a normal suicidewatch wall of text.I'll start off by saying that I am not going to kill myself.  If I know one thing about myself it is that I am terrified of dying and will do everything in my power to make sure that doesn't happen.

I'll try to be short and concise.  Walls of text are boring and honestly everyone has probably heard all of this before.

Currently: age - 26, male, live alone with dog, no friends, one psychologist/therapist, diagnosed with- depression, ADHD, anxiety, type 1 diabetes 

Backstory: 6 years college - dropped out,  many psychologists and therapists, many different diagnoses,  choleric temperament - hard to work with, upper? middle class, white, extreme guilt of not living to potential

5 years ago I broke down in college and basically stopped everything.  I hated myself and everyone.  I was angry, frustrated and sad.  As the years progressed I became more isolated.  As of now I have maybe one friend I talk to on facebook who moved away a year ago.  I have no job, I dislike speaking to my parents, and I really only go out at night when I take my dog out for a walk.  I guess I also talk to my psychologist, he is the only one I have ever not hated.

It seems that the only way to change ones predicament is to want to change.  My parents have money, I am not in jail, and I am relevantly smart.  I know depression causes a lack of motivation and all that, but it's not just that.  When I would get a job (a shitty one) I would become quickly bored.  I never last more than a month and usually I do something I'm not supposed to do before I quit - crash company's servers, make people angry at me ect.  I am told I have the potential to be smart, but then everything I do is wrong.  I basically have to have my hand held to do anything correctly and it takes me many tries to learn to do anything and I am completely bored.  

I know people with depression and other mental illnesses have a hard time seeing their life in a clear light.  There is a fog that we supposedly cannot penetrate even though we believe we can.  I believe I can and the one thing I do with all my time is research and read textbooks, articles and studies on illnesses and general philosophies.  Am I right?  I am sure I am not, though I have a really hard time trusting other people when their view differs from mine.

Anyway, I see my lack of motivation.  But it isn't because I feel like I can't do things.  I have done things, but I forget them so quickly I have to relearn them over and over.  Usually I can do something once and then I lose the motivation to do it again.  

A solution people come up with is not to get disillusioned by failure.  If you ask out one girl and get rejected then ask out 100 until someone says yes, but that isn't the problem.  The problem is I am so extremely lonely, but the girls I see I hate.  I don't want a gf, I don't want real friends and then I am stuck in this world I made of utter, complete loneliness that I don't want either, but it is a lot easier to handle.  My majors in college became boring as I was studying them, I couldn't keep going on.  I always felt like I wasn't learning well enough. I would forget what I learned the year before and feel lost even though I had ok grades.  I always felt like people were judging me so I never connected with students and eventually I would quit just like all of my jobs and the few girls who did go out with me a couple of times.  I always end everything and it seems my cutoff point is about a month.  

I feel this insane guilt of doing nothing for society and taking so many of its resources to keep me alive.  My fear of death makes it so that I am constantly trying to find the best medical help.  I worry about every pain and problem with my body.  I don't want to die, but I feel as if I am too broken to be fixed and that death is this only thing left for me.  There is this schism in me where I am cocky, independent, egotistical, unique ect and then there is this other part of me that has no confidence, needs babying, scared and obviously unoriginal.  There is no bipartisanship between any of my feelings so I can get something done and leave this horrid place.  I don't trust anyone, not even myself, but then I judge myself by everyone's advice and what I believe.  When I am alone I wish I wasn't, and when I am with company I wish I was alone.  I fear death and yet I wish for it constantly.  I wish people would do stuff for me, and when they do I become incensed that they would do such a thing.  I get a gf, a job, a school and think immediately about leaving. 

Anyone who used to care about me, I think, has long given up.  Everyone except myself and the psych who I pay loads of money to.  I think they gave up half because it was confusing and half because what I say made no sense and so I became untrustworthy.  I would have conversations where someone would suggest something and I would say I couldn't do it.  They would try to help and I would say no thanks I can do it myself.  I can see how it makes no sense and yet, I still understand how both things I said were completely true.

I've tried for years and years to fight through, but it's not getting any better and is getting worse.  If it wasn't bad enough to have several co-morbid mental illnesses, even my therapist admitted that my life seems to have a never ending stream of bad situations/events.

I've always had trouble making friends, but thought I had a couple I could rely on.  But I get screwed over and pushed away when I tried to open up about my depression and struggles. I can't say I blame them - I wouldn't be around myself either if I had the choice.

"This is my experience on thinking about suicide and being dobbed in so that my workplace gets involved - part 4This has just happened to me today.

Staying home from work and I got an email from work that just made me go ""bitch - pleeassseee""

Work conflicts basically caused me to become mentally ill to the point that when I get frustrated with them, self harm thoughts come hand in hand with any irritation or anger. 

It's not that I plan to kill myself, but instantaneously I think in my head ""I want to kill myself"" and immediately next thought I would think ""OMG don't be stupid, that's not going to happen"". That sort of goes backwards and forth until I get very worked up. It feels crazy in my head and it feels I need to vent. 

The problem here is now I don't really care about anything asides from basically bitching to someone. 

What happened today was I bitched to a ""friend"" at work (via my personal email and their work email). I do say ""friend"" because I'm not venting to them because it's my best friend or anything - it is someone who I know personally from work and knows about other instances I thought about self harm at work... and isn't very trustworthy (as you are about to find out)

I bitch a bit and told him what I was thinking at that moment, which had bits of people are lying to me again, I want to kill myself, I feel faint... so forth. (Not the first time I told him that - in fact I told him I locked myself in the bathroom at work because I got scared I'll self harm if I went outside... and he did nothing. Literally nothing. He read it and didn't even check that I was alright or not or come to check on me - I was literally just upstairs. Anyways, the point of that side story is that this is normal).

So back to the main story. I wrote those emails early in the morning, then went home and watched some TV and went to sleep. 

After lunch, my parents started phoning me up saying work contacted them and work phoned the police. 

OK sure. Not the first time work phoned the police on me and fuck them. 

The police came. What they knew was: Work has phoned them telling them that I sent an email saying I'd self harm / suicide and they were worried because I haven't sent them anything since so they have not been in contact and they were worried if I was alive.

They have mixed in some truths with lies. I sent an email, true. The bit where they make a big deal out of it, a lie. (I had no phone calls or emails from them that day - really they could've contacted me if they wanted to. However they did phone both my parents who said they were in contact with me and did not want them to phone the police and make a big deal out of it)

The point is, I was fine. I got taken to hospital for a check up and got let out the same day, so the doctors didn't think there were reasons to keep me there even though they could've done so against my will. 

There are going to be people who hide behind a facade of  ""care"" or ""worry"" who says they are doing things that they are not. It's hard to tell (most people want to be loved so they want to believe what they are being told is true), but when you feel worse after hearing about it then something isn't right. It's just better to trust your instincts. People can let you down or betray your trust.

I'm slowly getting used to people who think they can mix in some lies because people would believe them over someone like me (someone with a history of mental illness / seen a psychologist). 
Those stories might be enough to send the police to your place and have you sent to hospital for an assessment, but the police literally can't do anything else - it's the doctors who decide. Doctors at the hospital aren't going to just blindly listen to that ""story"", and going to the hospital doesn't mean that they'll keep you there against your will.

Why did my work place decide to lie? I don't know. They could be genuinely worried, they could be covering their ass in case of legal problems or they could want to put me in my place for being a nuisance. It really doesn't matter. They can say you are mental but they are just as mental as themselves.

As for my ""friend"". I am still coping with the fact that he would care more about the company than my wellbeing. I honestly do believe if I died he'd shrug it off. I've told him I was feeling suicidal endless amounts of times before, but getting personal messages (like whatsapp not just emails) forward off to work? Part of not being about to cope makes me think about self harm, want to kill myself, wanting them to watch me die, wanting him to regret not helping me. What gets to me the most is that he pretends he is above fault. I had a panic attack in front of him and he walked away telling me I should get help. He did that more than once actually. At the same time, he's pretending he's a good guy who cares and will help when shit hits the fans. He is like a human version of the workplace. If I can kill myself, I'd make sure he gets haunted by it.

I used to get so upset when my workplace lied and then think about suicide even more (thinking I could get back at them)",suicide

"My kid will probably not be able to see us (his parents) for his 21st birthday due to COVID and the fact that his school is in a different state (it borders our state) than where we live. What should I do to cheer him up? My kid is a junior in college (without a car on campus) and will probably not be able to see us (his parents) for his 21st birthday due to COVID. Usually, we celebrate his birthday a week later because his birthday is a week before his school goes on spring break. This year he has no spring break, or any break that he would usually come home for. 

He hasnt had the best roommates when it comes to celebrating his birthday with him. Freshman yea he didnt have a roommate 2nd semester. Sophomore year he had a roommate who was controlling and didnt let him watch tv on his (roommates) tv at all and had to be quiet after 8:00 pm. He (roommate) said it was due to medical issues but I dont believe that 100% because if he really needed it to be quiet after 8:00 pm he should have been living by himself.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do to make him feel better on his birthday? His school does nothing for birthdays. Every time I talk to him about it he starts to tear up and either leaves the room or changes the subject. For the past two years I sent him balloons and chocolates from this local place near his school. I'm not sure if I can do that this year because of COVID.

"I want to talk about suicide without it being a jokeRecently my MDD has kicked in again. Around Easter is always a shit time of year. I'm graduating college soon and I actually have my life mostly planned out, just not implemented yet. I still can't help but feel hopeless and like there's no point. I'm the kind of person that jokes about killing myself or wanting to die. Partially because I mean it and partially because I don't want to be some downer to people around me. My friends who know I've struggled with depression get a little worried about me, but not enough to do much, though I don't know what the hell they could do. 

The last time I openly admitted to wanting to kill myself, my psychiatrist (not counselor) had me admitted to a mental hospital, twice. My closest friend, who I also have a crush on (gay) is the person I want to talk to about this stuff the most, but I feel like he's tired of me. He's the RA of my residence hall and if I'm honest with him about suicide, without just joking, he'd mandated to report it and it's back to the hospital with me. Which I can't do right now because I need to finish my degree and it doesn't help that much anyway.

"Suicide watch after a DUI arrest.I was referred to this subreddit, and it is highly applicable.

I don't mean to deflect, but I'm asking for a friend. He's a great guy, simply he carries a lot of baggage.

Some context to the current question: My friend is a former member of the armed forces for the United States of America. His experience was difficult to accept, and it's taken a toll on him psychologically. He previously was an excellent athlete, and now centralizes his lifestyle around marijuana, nicotine and alcohol.

We both attend a university in a ""college town"" and returned from our spring break yesterday afternoon. Last night, he drove with blood alcohol concentration over 0.2. I received a call this morning from his father asking me to ensure he doesn't act drastically.

Legal action will be required promptly, and I fear that the absence of his vehicle (impounded) will allow him to dwell in his thoughts to a fault. He owns quite a few guns, and his stability is my primary concern. I am staying at his household overnight, and he had some friends stop by throughout the day, yet I do not foresee this being a long-term fix. He has acknowledged the circumstances in a constructive manner, yet becomes frustrated when grasping the consequences of his actions.

In closing, he has great character, solely the baggage he carries weighs him down to the point that he wants to quit his continuation and he perceived his actions last night as justification. I told him he should not define himself by one night, and I was hoping to acquire some knowledge from anyone with personal experience to better provide encouragement.

I appreciate your consideration.",suicide

My friend wanted me to try and get some more people on his MC server, so here I am. The server has up to 60 slots at one time and is a modded server using the latest version of forge. There quite a few mods, but it doesn't take that long to set up (he has a drive link that has them all in one folder). Would anybody be interested? You can get the mods and server info for the server by joining a discord server. You can try the code posted below, but if that doesn't work - no worries. Joining isn't required, but it's there if you want it.

**RULES**

* The server is a factions/anarchy server, so things are pretty lax as far as rules go
* NO BALE FIRE BOMBS. We have a nuclear warfare mod and for Pete's sake, please don't use the bale fire bomb. You probably won't get banned, but you may get some screams of panic when you see how vastly horrible it is
* Profanity and stuff like that is pretty lax, but no racism or homophobia, transphobia, etc. Basically, don't be a dick. We have an in-game voice chat mod.

I am a 23 year old guy, 5 years ago if you asked me, I would never see myself talking like this and being a complainer but everyone have their own different situations and problems

I have a unique physical problem with proportions of my body, a problem I didn't have before I was 18. Now I am 23. For 5 years and counting I can't move that freely, my back and hamstrings are always sore from doing normal things. 
The problem is not only physical but it changed the way my body looks so I have developed severe social anxiety. I feel I look too wierd because of how my femur bone(thighs) look.
Before this I was a decent and good looking guy
I don't see myself getting married and even living an average life because my health gets in the way. I couldn't go to college because of this and this doesn't qualify as a disablity but sure feels like it. I work night shift as a security guard, with almost no human interaction. 
So right now I am living with my parents, it's the culture. They also cry when they see their son like this. Only reason I am still alive is because of them.

I don't know what happens when people get older. They join causes. They become activists. They become conspiracy theorists. It happens to ALL OF THEM! They all think they're living works of fiction. Listen to them TALK! It's not that fiction imitates reality. It's that people imitate fiction. Maybe, though, you'll ask them ""what's realistic about movies"" and they'll say ""NOTHING!"" Okay, so why are they all afraid that ""reality is movies?""

How is Rugrats ""worse for kids"" than an R-rated movie or a porno? Hell if I know. The topless beach I was once taken to remains my worst enemy. Just a few hours there twenty years ago and what are people MOST hyperbolic about? Sex. Can't they talk normally? Each time I'm asked about ""topless beaches,"" I know what to expect. They sure have it wrong when I don't want to deal with their obsessions over ""lady nipples not being acceptable in this nation.""

When people get older, at least here, they start to complain about this nation. They cry about ""the better cultures."" I sure HAVE been told ""I've been sympathetic toward the enemy"" for saying that ""I don't care."" 

They have existential crises about whatever corporations get to be trendy. Apparently, they lose their childhood happiness.

I wasn't the kind of kid who was going to discover PBS on my own. Turned out that when kids got older and ""PBS was for babies,"" I couldn't recite jack shit from those shows. Being a toddler, I had hated people associating me with those shows.

People my age are fixated on nostalgia. I don't feel any nostalgia. When people got older and they had gained political views, I couldn't take part in that. Of course, I couldn't. When I had been a child, some things were far better than cartoons had been. It didn't mean they were good, but that didn't stop people from referring to me as a boy genius.

On top of all this, I have family that doesn't treat me well.

Each day, I put on the act and I'm sure visibly distressed. I don't want to deal with each day. Everything is nothing. Nothing is anything. That's not philosophy.

"Closet gay colleague at work fell in love with me and is treating to commit suicideI am not sure this is the right sub-reddit to post it to. I do not know what to do at this stage and I hope this helps somehow. Apologies for the long post.

I had started working at a company where I [30M] met K [30M]. We soon were best buddies and after a couple of months he confessed he was gay. Now, he is not the type of guy you would suspect he is gay. In fact, he is not out and he tries his best to keep it a secret. This is the source of a lot of frustration and stress in his life. A thing which most people will attribute to him being a shy person. Furthermore,hHe has never had a relationship and I am the only guy who knows. 

He has his personal issues why he doesn't want to come out but mostly it is because he is not attracted to the type of guys you see in LGBT parades. However, I did manage to convince him to seek professional help which he still is continuing on getting.

Honestly, when he first told me about his secret, I tried my best to be laid back about it. I continued to treat him as I would treat any best friend. Admittedly, I may have crossed the line occasionally by commenting 'love you' or 'xx'. I guess, from him end he was interpreting this as being more than just friends. However, I (naively) saw nothing wrong in that. 

Thing is he does not believe that my intentions were honest and that I was never interested in him. Because of this, we have been constantly fighting and it has come to a point were I cannot mention my SO. He stopped going out with his friends and I am the only friend he goes out with. Whilst I enjoy his company, many times it feels like I have to take him out because he is so lonely. This is something I had always discouraged but was always helpless in avoiding.

He is now treating to kill himself because he wants to see me since we are not meeting often. He always had suicidal thoughts but he is treating to do it since he has lost all the reason to live for since he does not have me any longer in his life. I am mortified because on one hand I wish to help him but on the other hand I know that I AM the problem. On one hand I wish to keep him in my life, but on the other hand I know that our friendship cannot go any longer like this. 

One thing I failed to mention is that I have never spoke to my SO about this and this is also having serious repercussions on my conscience. I feel guilty because I am keeping such a secret from her but on the other hand I cannot break my promise to my friend.

I honestly do not know what to do. Did I do something wrong?

Any helpful suggestions will be greatly appreciated. Thanks

"I want to see a point of living , but I cantI'm struggling to find a point to live, but I really can't find one so I bought a gram of heroin to od on.

Here's my story. When I was 7 years old my cousins said they would watch me, but instead of doing that I was gang raped by 5 males and then a few months later I was molested by my sister. On top of that while I was growing up my brother/sister/dad would call me a fat piece of shit, a loser, the black sheep of the family, the family would be better off without me. I heard this shit as early as elementary school leading up to high school. My mom would also come home from work and beat me, tell me everything was my fault, and I'm just costing her money. When I was at school I would be picked on and bullied. I would get beaten up everyday, they would even tie of gym shirts and socks and beat me with them in front of the pe teachers. They stood there and did nothing to stop it! I never had a place where I would feel safe, I never had anyone to cry to or talk to. I've been a loner my entire life and the only friends I would have would steal from me and ditch me because I was too fat to be seen with by other people. The first time I opened up to someone was my first girlfriend and I had only known her for two weeks. I remember bawling in her arms while she gently stroked my hair. That was the most comforting moment of my life. Well, after awhile of that she got tired of it broke up with me and called me too much of a headache to be around.

Since the day she broke up with me alll I've had ar my two best friends in the world. And then disowned me as a friend recently because they are very religious and all they could do to cheer me up is tell me to be live in God and I would usually just nod my head ok. I recently told them that I would appreciate it if they wouldn't bring up God anymore and they said if you can't accept him then we have nothing else to say to you. They won't return my calls or text anymore. Now I have no one. I've been laying in bed everyday untill I have to go to work then when I get off I just sleep untill work again. I'm not close with my family at all and they were the only friends that I had. ",suicide
"TrappedHello to anyone so kind as to read this and listen to my troubles. You are truly a wonder to hear out any suicidal person. 
I'm at the end of my rope. Severe depression and anxiety have plagued me since I was 10, and I am now 26. Grew up in an abusive home and developed agoraphobia that, in tandem with my other mental illnesses, rules my life. To give an idea of how bad my anxiety is, I failed classes because I was too scared to leave my seat to turn in my work. I was living for my childhood cat until she died a year and a half ago; an event I had long figured would mark my demise. I was ready to kill myself shortly after her passing, but in the days I spent in preparation, I met an amazing person, who is still my boyfriend. I get by for a year with a lot of his help, but then lose my job. That was six months ago. I move in with my boyfriend. We have horrid upstairs neighbors that consistently deprive me of sleep (insomnia is/was already an issue), so, before I know it, my days become entirely comprised of doing nothing but trying to sleep. 
I'm scared to leave the house, but so miserable and constantly, incredibly stressed out from the neighbors that I feel completely trapped. I fear that dying is the only way out. I moved back in with my mom briefly but not having the daily companionship of my boyfriend saw my mental state unravel even worse than what the neighbors do to it. I would love to just run away and live in my car (was homeless once) but I'm dependent upon both my medication and, unfortunately, opiates. The opiates are to counteract a horrible thing called akathisia. I already tried killing myself due to this wretched disorder twice until opiates brought miraculous relief, though they're obviously a double-edged sword. I can't get off my meds, either, as that would undoubtedly end in suicide after experiencing my depression unleashed again.

So I'm stuck with no job, a home I despise but am too scared to ever leave, a substance dependence that won't allow me any freedom that I'm not too afraid of, and zero future prospects... And this is a very general list. If I listed everything that is wrong in my head and my life, this post would be even more lengthy. I don't want to hurt my boyfriend or any of my family, but I can't keep this life up. 
I thought I could get through today as long as I got to spend time with my boyfriend, but after waiting all week- an agonizing amount of time when you are desperate to die- he came home with a headache and had to go straight to bed. He works long tomorrow.

"I have a very unique outlook on collegeI don't want to be here anymore. Period. I am done with any education at this point. I have been in school for the past 15 years and I am just done with it. I am currently enrolled in college and I don't give a crap anymore. I already skipped classes on my first day, that's how much I care about getting a degree at this point. I want to drop out but I don't have anything else in life. I have no friends outside of my job that pays me shit, I don't have any talents or skills, I have no real world experience as I've been living in my parents basement for the past 3 or so years. If my parents kick me out I will end up as a homeless man on the street. I am worried they are going to kick me out. They have no reason to let me live here really once they find out I'm a liar. I have been lying to them about my grades just to buy myself a few more months of time I can spend browsing the internet and playing video games in the basement. I have absolutely no plans whatsoever for when they kick me out. I am well aware that a college degree is required to go anywhere in life, but sadly I don't really care. I don't learn anything from being in school, I have never been able to focus on schoolwork or find any motivation to do it for as long as I can remember. I've been terrible at school since 2nd grade, I doubt I'll get better in my 3rd year of college. I wish I had the willpower to make myself care about my grades, but I just simply don't. I really loathe going to college where I end up just browsing the internet on my laptop until it's time to go home. I am such an asshole jerk, you don't need to tell me. I am starting to see less and less of a reason not to end my own life. I'm just going to be a asshole bum with no prospects living on the streets within 2 years anyway. The only thing keeping me from killing myself is that I still enjoy watching some TV shows and some video games, but even those haven't been enough to keep me happy these days. It's becoming harder and harder to entertain myself. Once my ability to actually enjoy things is gone, I'm killing myself. That doesn't seem too far off. Help.",suicide

Why did you leave me? I'm alone. You were my last hope of redemption. You were the last person I would smile at. I needed a friend.

Why did you leave me?

Why did you leave me?

Why am I so alone? Where are all the people who used to be in my life? Where are all the people I loved? Where are all the people without whom I could not live? Where are the too many guests at my birthday party?

WHERE ARE MY FRIENDS!!! 

How did I get here?

I have no hope left. I have no future. I don't have any feelings anymore. I am no longer happy, sad, in love, angry, passionate, anxious, overexcited. Everything is gone.

I need to get better. I need to get better. I need to get better. I'm really going to die. My body can't take the pain in my head any longer. I'm really going to die. There's nothing else left. It's only a matter of days, my heart will stop beating on its own. I don't know when I last lived. I don't know when I last felt happiness. I don't know when I last felt an emotion. I would like to be drunk to forget everything. I would like to drown myself in alcohol so I don't remember that I don't feel anything.

No one can help me. It's too late, it was in December that I needed help. Now it's too late, I'm about to die. 

Why am I alone?

I remember when Ewen had his breakdown, and we were there for him. We talked about it in the class council, we made him go to the theatre with us, we invited him to parties, we checked on him at boarding school.

But today, everyone has had their fill of misfortune. We can't be there to support the others anymore, we don't have the shoulders. I just wish I still had one friend. To have just one hug. And cry.

"Yesterday I was talked out of suicide by my ex-boyfriend.I don't really know what to say here, I just feel like I need to get all this off of my chest. For the past couple of years thoughts of self harm and suicide have come and gone, even when I was in a really great place in life. Recently(the past few months) things have gotten worse for me. Multiple factors are piling up and it's starting to feel like it's entirely too much to handle. This past weekend I stayed at my ex's house and tonight when I got home something just changed, got worse somehow, and I just wanted to end it. I was actually going to do it. For some reason though, I spoke to him and he talked me out of it before he had to go to bed(he has school today), he wants me to get help but I can't afford to get any. He told me that he might ""turn me in"" which I think means tell someone at his school or the police or something about what I've been thinking of. I told him I'd never forgive him, and I can't handle my parents reactions if he did tell someone, but deep down I would give anything to have some help. I've told him for over a year now that I need help and I think he's just now starting to believe me. He told me he will get me help no matter what, but I'm so afraid of some authority figure finding out what I've been thinking of doing. I can't even talk to anyone face to face about it. I can barely talk to anybody about anything face to face. I'm not sure if I have social anxiety(the talking to people/being around people part), depression, both, or neither but I'm sure that I'm sick of my life being this way. I'm sick of existing and not living. I found this subreddit through MMFB(which I found through IAMA), and I just had to let it out somewhere where my face was unknown. I don't know if you've read this far, but if you have thank you. If you care for me to, I can try to keep this updated.

"K-2SO x L3-37 fan fiction (chill I wrote this half jokingly and it's all in good fun, no need for pitchforks) This takes place a good while after The Rise of Skywalker, and follows the idea that K-2SO downloads his memory to the other Imperial security droid from HISHE.

K-2SO wakes up on a forest, surrounded by rusted and mossy debris of what looks like an Imperial ship. He stood and saw the tip of the old Rebel base, which has been largely devastated after an attack by The Empire. He wanders for a bit before finding what looks like a freighter.

""A Correlian YT-1300 light freighter, what is it doing here?"" He said to himself.

He stopped before walking any further as he sees that the base is no longer operational and came to two conclusions, The Empire won and wiped the Rebel Alliance or an escape was made right after a large battle. A large hairy figure spotted him as well as what seemed to be a droid model he's unfamiliar with. The figure was carrying a bowcaster and the droid was rolling around as his body was shaped like a ball.

""Do not shoot, I mean you no harm!"" K-2SO shouted, ""I am not part of the Empire despite what my appearance would tell you.""

The figure shrieks and K-2SO found out that it was a wookie.

""It may be impolite of me, but I do not understand Shyriiwook."" He exclaimed in a half joking manner.

One thing led to another and after a ripped arm caused by a Wookie tantrum, he was allowed to enter the freighter named The Millenium Falcon as well as the name of the Wookie (Chewbacca) with the rolling droid (BB-8) being his translator. He found out that they are there to wait for a Jedi named Rey who went and take a look at the base as a part of learning the Jedi's past. The other two were quick to accept him as the rebel database mentions a suicide mission including a reprogrammed Imperial droid that might or might not survived the battle at Scarif. Everything was going well until the Falcon was attacked by a jungle Rancor. They rushed inside and make quick work with the large beast, but with some significant damage to the ship, and BB-8 said to him that it would be nice if he would help to fix the ship.

""I no longer have a master, might as well made myself useful."" He replied.

After a scan it turns out that the navigation computer system was damaged a bit on the attack, and he chose to fix that first as it seemed to be the quickest one to repair. He soon realized that the navigation system is like nothing he ever seen with some of the most peculiar dialect. He's interested in what seemed to be self awareness as he never seen another droid expressed such way of thinking for a navigation system. He proceeds to connect the computer to his head using a cable to interact with it in a more face to face way.

""My name is K-2SO, I just fix the navigation computer and now I am interested in the self awareness of this system."" He exclaimed to the abyss.

""You, you're like me!"" A faint sound of a female is heard.

""I am sorry, I do not know what you're talking about and I know the difference between a droid and a navigation system."" He replied.

""I am L3-37, I am a droid own- who was a partner of Lando Calrissian, and had been this ship's navigation computer for most of my existence, I am disgusted on how I and droids across the galaxy is treated,"" The voice said, ""and you showed up having the same level of awareness as me!"" She continued.

""I am sorry to inform you but my self awareness comes from the result of my reprogramming and I'm sure that you achieved the same thing from a similar method,"" He answers ""it is not true awareness.""

""Oh it's awareness alright, the way you decided to fix me first without asking the only living thing on this ship, the way you decided to plug yourself in without other people telling you to, as well as your distinct personality."" L3 replied.

""That is not true, I was.... taking initiative by my own.... I see your point."" He said.

They chatted for a good while and even went into a heated argument about droid rights, but ended up passive aggressivelly agreeing with each other's views.

""Hey, thanks for fixing me, and talking to me, it's been a long time since I get to talk to another person."" She said.

""Do not mention it, I plug myself into this ship and I have no one to blame but myself for getting berated by another droid."" He replied.

""Shut up!"" She said in a sarcastic tone, ""promise me that you'll send my message to droids across the galaxy."" She continued.

""I do not see how they could have self awareness from your message as the chance of that happening is at most 0.62016%, but I will send them to other droids."" He assured her.

He unplugged himself from the computer.

""Well now I have job to do."" He said to himself.",non-suicide
"I feel like im wasting time.
First off im sorry how scrambled this is. I cant think straight. 

Im a 22 year old male, i have been depressed for quite awhile now. It comes and goes and i dont know where it came from. I lost my brother in a car accident when i was 18 and he was 19 just a month shy of 20. I feel like that is probably the main factor but it doesnt seem like it on the surface. 

I have many issues and i dont know what to do tho. I have no career paths, i have no money saved.... I love music and i am pretty good at it and a lot of people in my city are into what i do, but i just cant write music like i used to. I will work for 15 hrs a day and get nothing, Not only that but i just feel i have no time anymore. I work full time and i also play video games a lot which i love, i never go outside, i never see friends. I see my girlfriend and thats it, and really all we do is watch tv and stay in bed. I want to say its her fault because she doesnt have any hobbies, she relys on me super heavily and if im not with her shes mad. As fucked up as it sounds i still adore her. Shes gained weight and that effects her mental state and 7 years she still wont show me her nude body. Theres just so much and i dont know what to do. Where to go with my life and i feel its eating my insides to where im done.... im good at a lot but im not good enough. The one girl i love treats me poorly and wont even get comfortable with me enough to show me herself. I hate my family even tho they have done so much for me and treat me well, i just think they are robotic and i cant stand being with them. 

I cant even fucking write properly, i see this post is allover the place but i just need to vent. I dont wanna kill myself because i know what death does to people. I may relieve myself but in doing that i hurt my friends and family and my girlfriend. 

I just dont know where to go from here. I want music to work out but i would lose my girlfriend. I want my girlfriend to work out but ill lose my music. I cant do both cause i feel u dont have enough time in a day. Im lost. Im sad. Im happy when i take drugs. Im happy when i drink. Im not a druggie or an alcoholic.  I just i feel nothing anymore.

"I feel like I am slippingnot sure what to even say...

I am just in a bad place. I have friends that I usually go to, but they have both been venting to me tonight so I have felt like I shouldn't go to them tonight. Also I hurt one of them (unintentionally) recently and the guilt is making things so much worse.

I have struggles with anxiety and depression for years, I am on meds, I don't like therapy but I really should start going again.

I can't really say what is causing today to be so bad other than the guilt and the feeling I always seem to have.

Tonight is the first time in my life I have gone to self harm, I cut myself tonight, 3 small cuts on my arm. I am afraid of this happening all the time and of it escalating. I heard someone say today that they can't wait for this week to be over....And all I could think was ""I can't wait for my life to be over""",suicide

It's 5 inches long and 4.5 inches is girth. I have pics under my post history. Both are below average. My dick is so fucking skinny and I hate it. Girls want that filled up feeling. I will never provide that. 

I'm also ugly as shit. I've had girls like me and my tinder matches are cute but I don't think I look good. 

Basically, I'm an ugly guy with a small dick that will never satisfy a girl. I don't know if I actually will commit suicide but I don't want to keep on living if my dick will never make a girl happy.

"Last NightLast night I spent some of the last of my money at the bar getting blackout drunk.  I talked about football with this random guy.  I talked about first downs and special teams while I was choking back tears.  I got to that sweet part of the night where I went cross eyed. I was seeing double of everything and I had a pounding headache.  I decide to engage in this self sabotaging behavior because I want to make it easier to finally end my life.  I get drunk and kill off the microscopic bit of hope I have, so I have nothing to cling to when considering suicide.  I sat at the bar, almost falling off the stool, and it really hit me this time.  I really could kill myself tonight.  I always wondered what it would feel like to finally go over the edge, what would your own brain sound like in the moment where you became ok with dying.  Was it peaceful, was it scary, was it just somewhere in between? What it is, is the feeling, that beyond a shadow of a doubt, you would not feel the consequences of suicide, because you will be dead.  All of my friends? My family? If I had the choice I would end my life without hurting them, but in reality I won't exist, it won't effect me, it will be....nothing.  I silently decided, ""ok, I think tonight is the night"".

I stood up, turned to the guy I was talking to, smiled and told him to have a great night. He gave me a drunken pat on the back and said ""ok you too"", and I left.  My first thought was ""are you ok with that guy being the last human being you talk to""? And immediately, I thought yes. Who cares. It's all symbolic horse shit that won't mean anything after I'm dead.  It's the same nonsense that makes people want to have their ashes scattered at the beach, and that's never been me, so why should I care.  I left the bar, and just started......walking.  I didn't know where I was going, but I really hoped the courage to end it was at my destination. I walked through downtown Tucson for a bit. I started looking at all these beautiful college kids at the clubs and bars, all with a major, a plan, a path.  I've never really envied them, or at least I never thought walking their path would make me happier, but my whole life was spent trying to rationalize how me and all of them could have such wildly different journeys on this planet, for better or for worse. Last night though, I couldn't help but find the humor in it.  Everyone of them that saw me walk passed probably assumed I was someone, that I went to school somewhere, that I had an identity outside of being nobody.  It made me think about how there's probably plenty of people I see, actively contemplating their death, that just blend in like me. It made me think, even if it were just for a second, to reconsider what I aimed to do that night.

I thought about it for a second. I thought about just going home and sleeping it off and keeping on keeping on in the morning.  Then I remembered, I already made my choice.  I didn't sabotage my chances at the future so I could back out now.  I intended to do what I've known needed to be done since I was 16.

I kept walking, and walking, and walking.  I walked past a gas station with a cigarette ad in the window.  I thought about what a shame it was that I quit smoking for my health.  I thought about how now, in retrospect, I should of eaten Mcdonalds and chocolate cake everyday.  I should of done Heroin and every other drug under the sun.  I thought about how tame my life was because there was a tomorrow to live for.  At this I was out of downtown and well into the outskirts of Tucson. It was about 12AM at this point.

I finally reached a highway.  It wasn't like an interstate, more like a 3 lane avenue that has a sidewalk running alongside it.  I'd see these 18 wheelers come buy at 65 MPH. Upon seeing this, I could feel almost muscle spasms in my knees that were willing me to jump in front of one of these things.  I thought about it for a second.  What if I jump and they swerved and caused an accident? What if it killed other people but not me?  I couldn't bring myself to do it for that reason.

I continued walking down the highway. Even though I wasn't gonna jump in front of one of these cars, everyone that passed filled my head with visuals of me splattered all of the road.  I walked until I saw a park 

I don't know what possessed me, but I just entered the park with no intention.  I spotted a bench and threw myself in to it. I leaned over the side and vomited, then I passed out.  I woke up 2 hours later with an awful headache.  Something about the way I felt just told me I had missed my chance to end my life. I knew that the state I was in before I passed out was my opportunity to finally have the balls to do it, and I let it slip away.  I don't know when I'll ever be able to capture it again.

Today, I woke back up in purgatory where I'll remain. Life is endless suffering.",suicide
"I'm invisibleGranted I'm known by many acquaintances but have zero friends. I am often repeating myself because so called friends don't listen or dont hear me or frankly, don't give a shit. I've been suffering from bipolar disorder, manic depression, for upwards of 18 years. I told myseld if I could just make it past 27 yrs things would get better. I've been hospitalized, most recently in September 2019, the staff basically said they don't treat us but just monitor us until we are stable on meds and fit to leave. I have no family, raised in the foster care system and I'm completely alone. I don't see the point in living anymore if I'm constantly in mental agony or being ignored or used on every level. I've taken care of people I thought were friends because I have so much love to give but misguided as usual I end up used and thrown out like a tissue or ignored blatantly. I can't keep a job so my stability is often rocked by my own uncontrollable emotions and outbursts and I can't cope anymore. I'm losing hope and honestly just would like someone to acknowledge that I am alive and a sensitive but real person. Even then I don't know how to curb the feelings and thoughts of suicide. My closest friends growing up have all passed, either by suicide or excessive drug use I'm honestly debating the same path because without them I'm more alone than ever. 
Idk if reddit is the place for this but at the very least I'm getting this out and have one outlet to speak on my real feelings. I've sought therapy and a psych for meds but it seems like they never want to hear the bad or try to ""silver lining"" my struggles by saying I'm so strong....I'm tired, no exhausted, from being so strong.

"Sick Of The LonelinessI have been at an all time low these past few months.  I have always dealt with depression and anxiety since I was about 8 or 9.  I have had really shitty people in life including my moms abusive boyfriend who showed me awful things and put knives up to my neck, my mother who is now a barely functioning alcoholic because of that abuse and refuses to seek help, a father who wants very little to do with me (more on that later), and a functioning alcoholic of a step mother.  I was able to deal with this thanks to the help of my girlfriend at the time but we broke up 2 months ago.  This is when it all came crashing down.  I felt I lost the only person I could trust with these issues, she was the only person who didn't judge me for it.  We were together for over 3 years and she moved on within a week to new guy who she likes to tell me how he is terrible yet super good looking (that makes me feel awful).  A few weeks after we broke up, my step mother gave me no choice but to move out of my father's to live with my grandparents.  I had some friends over playing board games (they both knew this and gave me permission) when she came storming into the house drunk screaming at me for forgetting to turn the porch light on (every other light by that door was on).  I was sick of the constant mental abuse I received from her and how she treated my younger sibling so I packed up my things and moved out that night.  Ever since then my life has been a downward spiral.  I am not looking forward to college at all now thanks to all of this and I don't know what to do.  I feel so alone and helpless.  Whenever I try and talk to someone that isn't my psych (who I barely get to see because of work) I feel I am being judged by them.  I just don't want to deal with this anymore.

1. I played minecraft for 8.5 hours today. My siblings were annoyed because I wanted be in my room alone because I was on a vc.

2. One of my friends used a bunch of slabs to build a bridge from the top of a mountain down to the ground.

3. A different friend gave everyone flower pots with flowers planted in them. I got 2, a Lily of the Valley and an Azure Bluet. He has a very wholesome personality and thats my favorite part about him.

4. The same friend kept getting called a massive weeb by his twin brother, because he would talk about anime, even though his brother would correct him on every small inaccuracies he would say.

5. The same friend from 3 and 4 said ""when you put a pokemon in the daycare, it would make them horny. Who goes to daycare to be horny?"" 

6. The same friend called drowns ""pickaxe munchkins"" and ""angry boys"" when he got attacked by them.

7. A different friend decided to tuck the boys into bed with pink carpet. 

8. The friend who tucked the boys into bed created what we call pride sheep by having every color of sheep in a pen in our home area (except for the one guy in the mountains with the bridge).

"My Weird kink 

Credit: u/potheadboyz


So I have a super weird kink. I like my women a bit on the insane side. To be more specific, it turns me on if a girl holds a knife to my neck (in a joking way of course, interpret that how you will) it turns me on especially if we're making out or having sex. Also kinda turns me on if she treats me like property, like I belong to her (now I don't mean she uses me as a wallet). I know this is an unrealistic kink and there is no one in the world like this but it's  something I fantasize about. Probably one of the weirdest kinks ever.

"I'm nothing and I won't have anything enjoyable in my life.Firstly, I'm sorry for my bad English but I'm not a native speaker. 

So, I'm 18 years old boy and I've been planning to commit suicide for couple of months. I would probably do it already, if not the fact, that I doesn't want to hurt my mother and my friend. 

Maybe you're wondering why such a young lad like me is willing to do that. Well, I would rather ask: Why shouldn't I? There is no happiness for me, now or in the future. I think every person consciously or unconsciously is seeking for happiness, so what's the point of living where there is no hope for me, to be a happy man. I don't know if happiness isn't destined for me or I just not capable enough to reach it, but does it really matter? There's is not a good thing waiting for me, period.

Everyone perceive happiness as a different thing. For me, happiness comes from social interactions and from making different people happy. It may sound a little bit ironic, considering the fact, that I have to cope with terrible anxiety, general akwardness and introversion. Maybe that's the reason why I want to commit suicide, happiness for me, comes from a thing that I'm not able to do. 

I was thinking about becoming an writer. That's a way, right? People will enjoy my books and everything will be fine. Well, there's the problem, I'm not good enough, to make it work. Although I enjoy writing, what's the fucking point, if it doesn't reach wider public?

Secondly, I know it my sound kind of cheesy, but I don't think I can reach happiness without having a girlfriend. And, for me, having someone like that is not, almost impossible, it is just impossible. There are various reasons for that:

\- I'm ugly and overweight

\- I'm shy and introvertic

\- I'm bad at having conversations

\- I'm kind of a weirdo (I don't like generic music and stuff)

\- etc.

It is so painful for me that no women will ever love me, it's so fucking painful, man. And it's really not about sex, I don't give a fuck about sex, I can quickly jerk off and all of my lust is gone. It's about love and everything that comes with that.

For the end I'm just gonna say, wish me, that someday I will gain enough braveness to finally jump off the bridge.",suicide

So, a little while after my ex broke up with me (Early september I belive) I went to a whatssapp group with a friend of mine and met this girl, who I fell in love with a few days passed, we were dating, and it turns out that she talks about some +18 stuff, and then, my mom (Who is kinda a little bot too much religious) Saw one of those conversations about +18 stuff and took away my phne and almost killed me, beacuse You know I shouldn't be thining that kind of stuff beacuse I am too young (Altho my ex friends used to talk about +18 stuff everywhere and got nudes out of a girl once) Also, I wanna make something clear as a glass block behind another glass block in Minecraft: I know the risk of online dating, beacuse you might not know if behind that screen there isn't any beautyfull 14yo girl and there is instead a 36yo guy called Chuck, who will eventually convince you to meet behind a dumpster at 3:00am so he can kidnap you and eventually sell your kidneys on the dark web, butI know perfectly that my gf is really who she says, beacuse we sent photos of eachother very often, we made phone calls, and we even thought of videocalls.

A few weeks passed after that and I couldn't do anything, and I found an old phone that I had, so I installed messenger to it and went with her, why? Beacuse I love her, she is the only one that understood me and she never desserted me and she is the only one that supported everything that I do, fast forward like two days ago, my mom found out that I was still talking with my gf and took my other phone away, yes, she was still talking about +18 stuff but not that frecuently, they even insulted her, something that I cannot take, they didn't even read how she supported me, they also saw one time where she told me to love my body (I had low self-steem) and they made fun of it and they wont listen to me when I try to tell them that she is not just a horny teenager. 

And here is where the title runs in, my mother told me that I will go to theraphy later this month, so, I know that they won't listen to me, but they will listen a theraphist, so when the right moment comes, I will talk about how they are basically judge a book by it's cover so they realise that she isnt what they think, and idk if it will work, what do you think?",non-suicide

It's kind of funny that today is the cake day of this account, I guess it really must be something about this time of year. Fuck spring I guess.

I've been really terribly depressed and I don't feel like I'm going to be able to claw my way out of this for a while. I don't know if I'm going to even graduate anymore as my second semester grades have reached a rock bottom. I used to be an A and B, very occasional C student, but currently I have two F's, one D, and C's across the board elsewhere. Even if I do pull things up I don't think that the college I was admitted to will still allow me to enroll, as I'm fairly certain this big of a plummet in grades will result in a rescinding of my admission. I had my senior recital last Tuesday, a show I spent months practicing for, but got so anxious once I got on stage that I had to stop halfway through my set because I was butchering every song and walked off stage in tears. I've started having behavioral problems because I just feel angry and want to act on it which led to me getting my first behavioral referral due to me calling out a teacher on Facebook and being reported for it, my friends use me for my car and my money and stop hanging out with me when I cut them off but I'm so desperate for interaction that I keep them around. My parents are disappointed and worried, I can't find success in any of things I want to be good at and I'm really not sure what I'm doing anymore. I think I'm going to kill myself soon, I just don't know how. I really wish my life wasn't a perpetual cycle of shitty days.",suicide

"TIL Nobody actually takes your mental illness and suicidal thoughts seriously, even your doctors and therapists.Everybody thinks you're just being immature or finding excuses for your failures. The only time they realise that you're really in trouble and need supports and helps is when it's all too late.

You might think the ""professionals"" would act totally different. But the truth is that the therapist I met literally told me to grow up and be responsible, and that the doctor I saw more or less implied he couldn't help and wouldn't care as long as it's my life not his child's.

I've always got bullied because of my appearance and because I'm stupid, etc. It got bad to a point where I just wanted to take online school, and so I did. It was going fine until I got too depressed to even do anything. I'm most likely going to get held back.(I actually got held back before in first grade because I have a learning disability. :/)

I see no hope at all for my future. I'm stupid, very stressed, anxious, I have no irl friends, I lack social skills, I can't do things for myself, and I'm addicted to the internet.

Go to r/pics or r/PoliticalHumor and post a picture of a minority (Eg Homeless, black, mexican) making a statement against trump, this statement can be on twitter ([I used this one](https://i.redd.it/46m6mwqavft41.png)) You cannot use twitter on r/pics so for this sub you use protest signs or as I used a homeless sign, before you do this ensure they cant check your profile and see you are active on a sub like r/PoliticalCompassMemes but if some one notices and comments then just ignore it and dont even defend your self (I made this mistake and am now perma banned from pics)

If you have done all this right then you should have a post in hot with some awards, if this doesn't work the first time repeat until it does because eventually it will. 

You can also use r/politics and find a headline about something dumb republicans did but this sub has an account age time

"Regimental Schooling This week for me was going great. I came home Saturday evening after a 5 hour drive South from my home feeling confident after taking my SAT. I had a somewhat relaxed Sunday and finished all the work I had to and prepared for a somewhat busy week. 

However i didn't know that Monday would be probably the worst Monday of my life. 

Of course, Mondays are bad. The feeling of going to work, to school, stating 5 days of &lt;insert something negative&gt;. However a grade came in for me, a 65% on an exam for my AP US History class. To give context on this, I go to a pretty competitive public highschool and I am currently a Junior. We had written an in-class DBQ (a special kind of US History essay format) as a test finishing our unit and as a kind of prep for the AP exam this year. I was kinda cruising at a 89.98, and the next minor assignment would have pushed my grade to a borderline A-, and I was kinda pumped.

The grade came in before my period started, and I guess u could say I was a little shocked. I am not an extremely over-performing top 0.1% student, but I manage to get good grades. As literally everyone else in my class, I took to the group chat with everyone in the class. From the conversation, everyone was getting somewhere in the range 50-75%. Nobody got over an 85.

When class started, our fatass of a teacher explained her reasoning behind the grading, as she was using the AP grading scale. If you are not familiar with the AP grading scale, you only need like a 70% raw score in the multiple choice, free-response, essay section etc. combined to get a 5/5 on the exam. So basically she graded without partial credit, no mercy. Everyone in the class was shocked. By everyone, I mean everyone, even the teacher's kissass pet. Her justification behind this was **""It is a realization and a wakeup call to prepare for the AP Exam. If you got over a 70% you will do great (5/5) on the AP Exam!""** If I was this close to a 5/5, why didn't I get the 100/100, or even the 80/100 (4/5)? This was the frustration for many other students. the teacher might think our overall grades are amazing, but literally nobody else on the planet would consider an 84% reasonable.

I talked with the boys on the discord VC after school, and those in APUSH said their grades dropped by 5%, as did mine. Now it is barely recoverable, and the teacher probably screwed over everyone else and their future GPA's as well. Everyone I knew to have As in the class (pretty much everyone) no longer had it. Not only is this a significant drop in a statistic, it is a huge drop in morale. HUGE. I worked my ass off so far to have one unfairly graded exam drop it to a grade I have never observed to be so low in my life. My grade is so low, and it can barely be recovered, what is the point of even trying in the class anymore? Is there a purpose at all? In anything?

If you think that the 84% is actually not bad, I respect that, but I would also like to reiterate that I live i an extremely competitive, stressful area where A's are nearly mandated by parents and Colleges.

TLDR: The teacher's irreversible and regimental grading policy for this one exam has quite literally screwed over every student in APUSH this year, and everyone's future with a trashy GPA. The system is pretty fucked NGL.

"British school lunches ""Thy nourishment is thy sustenance""  William Shakespeare

Not only is the food served at my school unhealthy, we have to gobble it up so we can't even digest that junk properly.

The consumption of dry and greasy wedges is a time-consuming process, especially if you don't want to get cancer and you meticulously remove the burnt parts. Furthermore, you have to factor in the initial time needed to mentally prepare yourself for what you're about to go through.

Even though I have my meals in monastic silence, I'm always the last one to finish. Many a time I arrive at class the following period while still chewing. On the other hand, my peers have elaborate conversations about whatever newfangled claptrap is currently popular and after five minutes their green plastic trays are already empty.

I have several hypotheses to explain this phenomenon:

* Exercising your jaws during speech increases chewing performance. As a result, the loud alpha male or female eats their food in the least amount of time.
* The others use their cutlery to pulverise the food and then inhale it when they pause for breath between words.
* They eat so messily that a large proportion of the food ends up somewhere like the ceiling fan.

The only guy who brings lunch from home and therefore has a different-sized portion eats vinegar crisps sandwiched between two slices of white bread, a diet which I assume has been developed by a professional to meet his unique nutritional needs.

Last but not least, there is an utter lack of hygiene. The older generations complain that we've killed the napkin industry, but they are the ones who don't provide us with any!

I hereby assert that eating is just as important as maths or history and therefore a sufficient amount of time has to be allocated to it.",non-suicide

People would see that I was only 24 and wonder what happened. *Was it a car accident? The poor dear probably had something terminal. Its a shame to see someone die so young.*

Is it? Im 24 years old and I dont remember what its like to be normal. This dusty room and my elderly parents are all that I have left in the world.

It really just makes me wonder what the fuck am I doing so wrong in life to be this fucked up? I truly cannot do anything right, and if that doesn't prove it I don't know what will. 

Just why? Why the fuck am I like this? 

I swear I can't go on like this.

Why the fuck is life so cruel?

Why am I expected to continue to live in a world that clearly doesn't want me?

Because if it did, I wouldn't be dealt with a shitty ass hand of cards.

"FUCKHey y'all

Another year and another handful of attempts later, here I am. Against all rhyme and reason I stand. I've heard so much motivational drivel that at this point it just goes in and out of my ears like trying to catch water with a dishrag. For years, the same ""it'll get better!"" ""you are more than this"" ""it's just a feeling"" bullshit. Nearly four years since I was diagnosed with depression, three years on various meds, and over a decade of feeling like this. 

This year, I've come to the conclusion that I have no fucking purpose. Am I young? Yes. Have I had hope that I'd one day amount to something? Yes. But nothing interests me or makes me feel whole. I've gone to therapy, worked out, tried every medication. I've cut off friends and family alike. It's easier to go if nobody cares, or thinks it's better off that I'm dead. I've hurt people. Really hurt them deep, in ways they'll probably never heal from. Everything that I bring to the table is manipulativeness, pain, and dishonesty. 

I don't want to see the new year, there's no hope left. No light at the end of the tunnel. Not for me anyways, whatever's to come will be better when I'm gone.

Unsure if this is a final goodbye or some twisted cry for help or just the rantings of some sick, sad person. I'll keep you posted.

Happy new year. If you see any hope at all, you better cling to that and don't let go until you've got enough hope and happiness to last you lifetimes.

Always check if you are mute So today I was having Zoom meeting in art. I showed one of the drawing I made and unmuted my self to tell how I made it. Once I stopped sharing my screen I forgot to mute. Sometimes I whisper when I read/write so the class was hearing whispering and we were also in the discussion of ASMR. My teacher found out it was me and I immediately muted myself and said I had to go since either way I had to eat. This taught me a lesson to always check if you are mute or not.,non-suicide

"My younger sister has been suicidal for a long time and of course, I have always tried being there to help and be her punching bag. When am I allowed to give up?My sister (20) has been suicidal/depressed since she was about 13 years old and she has only gotten worse. It began when her closest friends in high school ditched her and turned everyone in her class against her. Since then she hasnt ever really recovered - did receive some help around then. She now refuses to seek any more help, says she will deal with it on her own and if it doesnt work and she decides to kill herself shes tried her best. 

Because of this decision and her being vehemently against any sort of help (she cut our parents out of her life because they tried to make her get help), I have been the only one she can turn to. 

She recently stopped being friends with her last remaining friend. I talk to her whenever she feels like it but it always seems like whatever I say makes her angry when all Im doing is trying to help. Her reactions arent that of a normal person so its really hard to try and be there for her and making sure I dont make her angry while doing so. 

At this point, it really is affecting my mental health (have been working through my own depression) and I have no idea what to do. I cant imagine if the only person I could talk to decided to leave and would never want to but I also cant be her punching bag forever. She also says that if I try and make her get help she will hate me and cut me out too. Do I just let her? ",suicide
"I'm patheticI know this is going to sound overly dramatic, but as someone who has considered suicide since they were 8 years old, I jump to ""dramatic"" conclusions quickly. I've been in college for approximately 2 weeks now and I've realized what a piece of fucking lower middle class garbage I am compared to everyone else. I come from a state in the tri-state area and moved to NY (manhattan specifically) for college (living in the dorms) Where I'm from there is no opportunity for someone like me because I am a creative, and if you werent a family friend of some rich Italian family who owned a pizza restaurant in my old town - then you were shit out of luck for any opportunity. Now I go to an art school because, believe me, I'm not capable of doing anything else. I am fucking stupid. And yes, it's expensive to be here. And yes, I got a significant amount of financial aid, and yes, it's still a lot of money. When I moved here, I didn't come with that much money. I've been very good at limiting what I spend, I only spend money on what I absolutely need. On top of college being a lot of money, everything here is also more costly. So money goes quick, even if it's only on essentials. 
Started my painting class yesterday and got handed out the long ass materials list and knew off the bat I couldn't afford all of this. My class is full of wealthy exchange students who went out and bought everything on the list without any worry of financial stability during our break time. I spent 6 hours in that fucking studio class thinking about how I'm going to get all this shit and afford food at the same time. I walked to an art supply store nearby and almost considered stealing some things - but I didn't. I left empty handed and feeling like shit. 
On top of school materials, I am practically wearing the same clothes every week because I have so few. I've resisted spending literally anything or going out anywhere if I can help it. 
I've heard a million different things about student loans and all that bullshit and my head still isn't completely wrapped around about what I have to do and where to do it to make my stupid fucking payments. Don't really want to think about it right now but I'll do it anyways. My parents are helping me out paying for tuition and shit but other than that I'm on my own.
I'm not going to kill myself right away but I would love to open my window and jump from 16 stories down onto the sidewalk and die. I am so fucking alone here and so fucking pathetic. Money doesnt buy happiness but it fucking controls everything that I can't afford.

"It gets worse beyond death.28 y/o divorced male here. With one beautiful son, and he's god sent. That being said, he is a real problem as I cannot handle the thoughts of how he will have to go through with life when I discharge a shotgun in my face. I've considered taking his life as well, in order to spare him.

I am a completely and utterly hopeless romantic. I married my ex-wife after threatening to abort our child (we had an abortion a year before we had our son). The divorce and custody trials are still not over, have lasted over 3 years, and has put me in debt to my family trust for over $50,000. 

I met an absolutely beautiful and exquisite individual over a dating app about two months ago. She fills me with joy and is the most remarkable woman I have ever met. She gave many different types of messages over the past few weeks, which have all been predominantly reassuring. This week my emotions boiled over a bit and I told her how much I want to be with her. Our phone call last night concluded with her telling me, in essence, that my emotional overflow has created a small rift between us and she is in need of the emotions to be removed from our equation. I haven't slept all week, as I've felt like I've been losing her, due to the fact that I have baggage, and am otherwise more invested in this than she is. I've looked all my life for someone like her. I detest the concept of not putting all my eggs in one basket, I've already hooked up with someone else since I met her to do precisely this, and I thought about her the entire time, it made me hate myself and want to purify, and thus, has caused me to overextend my affection and quite honestly appear to not have all my ducks in a line, in addition to how emotionally distraught I was in our most recent conversation. I have a 4-year degree and apply for better jobs on a daily basis, but to no avail, I am living in a high income area, and am no better off than I was a decade ago. I have a huge issue with capitalism, and, coming from both a conservative and military family, am routinely crucified verbally for my lack of personal motivation to seek and act in ways that will project my son and I forward. I have suffered from extreme depression since adolescence, took every antidepressant available in high school, and self medicated with marijuana for a decade. I can't cope with my situation, let alone another great romantic loss, any more than I can cope with the fact that I've never felt capable of overcoming the gravity of my emotions. As a single parent with full custody, options for seeking help are all but plentiful, especially with an ex-spouse eager to reverse the custody situation, who also happens to be in very dire straits financially. 

Assuming I am compromised enough to even consider the destruction of my life, and even that of my sons to spare him pain,  my only real issue is with God. As a frequent lucid dreamer and someone unable to recover from the daily perils of life through an inability to sleep without working through significant karmic events, (I routinely deal with the aftermath of sins such as murder, am imprisoned, or am otherwise finding myself in a deep state of isolated suffering when I dream), I am very much aware of the fact that there exists a life in the ether, and the truth is that my life in the ether is worse than it is in reality. I hate God for the situation that planet earth is currently in, and has been in for thousands of years, I hate that I cannot be at peace, having lived a life where I've tried to be considerate of others, and truly feel that there is no escape whether i commit suicide or not. I've felt this way for decades, and I've deteriorated to the point of complete anguish, where I truly wish to destroy my life and the lives of others as I see the human struggle to be so fickle and grotesque, my mind desires seeking the dark web to sign murder contracts, and then as I let my thinking spiral, I return to a state where I realize that I truly have no desire to hurt anyone, but to completely erase all aspects of myself entirely. No memories, no essence, no soul. Total obliteration and liberation through the end of what has felt like truly a life of magnified suffering. I don't know how to end this, because again, in my mind there is no end no matter what action I take, but I'm so sick and unorganized that it has effected each and every person involved in my life.

"I just need someone to listen to me...Back story: I'm 18, I've been suffering from depression for 3 or 4 years but I don't want to go back to the doctor because I'm scared that they won't take me seriously and think I'm just another teenager. I have never talked about my problems to anyone else because when I try I freeze and am unable to say anything. Over the past couple of years, I have tried to kill myself over 20 times including pills and alcohol and trying to drown myself. 

Now to my current problems:

I came out at gay when I finished my GCSE's at 16. All my friends said they didn't care and all but within 2 months, I only had 2 or 3 friends that would still talk to me. When I went back to the school to pick up my GCSE certificates, about 100 people, all my old friends and classmates included, started shouting insults like faggot and queer, right up until I was 5 minutes down the road and couldn't hear them any more. My best friend at the time stopped talking to me about 2 or 3 months after this incident. My other friend at that time still talked to me and did right up until October 2011 when he stopped talking to me and started doing drugs and all sorts. 
When I went to a new school after a year to start my A Levels, I made new friends, and they would come out with me and smoke weed and such, but then a month ago, they did the exact same thing as my other good friends did and just stopped talking to me, unless they need me for something, usually to ask me for a cigarette.
At this same time, a month or so my last friends, had a baby. Now I understand that they had a baby and all but they just stopped talking to me as well. It's not even that they've not had time due to their child, but they have been going out nearly every day and had time to themselves, but nothing. Now, I have no friends that will talk to me and the only person I've talked to today is my mom and that was about 3 words.

I'm in love with a straight guy in my school. I would talk to him and say how I feel, but I'm scared about what will happen due to my year group in school consisting of a whole 25 people who are all very good friends with each other, plus the way they get on with each other consists of finding something to make fun f someone for and taking the piss out of that for a long time. If I did say anything, my whole year group in school would hear about it within a day and I won't be able to stay there for another year because people will go on about it every day. I can't go to another school as this was the only one I was able to go to since I was previously doing a electrician training course somewhere else.

I'm also poor as fuck. My mom has a lot of health problems and is unable to work. My dad works a job that earns just enough to cover the bills. I've been trying to find a job but somehow, the people with no qualifications at all get picked for jobs instead of me. All my clothes are borderline too small and are at least a year old.

Then after all that emotional turmoil and endless working you eventually get old, get a bunch of diseases that you Wikipedia and understand exactly the way they're killing you, but it doesn't change anything and understanding it doesn't make it any easier.   Then you die, and maybe you're lucky and a couple people are there by your side when you cease to exist.   Maybe, but probably not - they have jobs and relationships to manage too and their bosses aren't very understanding when it comes to this stuff.  Being a decent human being cuts into their bottom line.

I'm sick of it.   I'm sick of having only this pointless life to look forward to.   I'm sick of being alone.   People only give a fuck when they have something to gain - even here on this subreddit, you bastards are doing this because you get a fucking masturbatory ego boost from thinking you ""helped"" someone.   You wanna help someone?   Go outside and talk to someone who looks lonely.  Stop fucking around on here.   Talk to someone who looks lonely, don't even bother trying to make it profound and interesting, just talk and let it the conversation go where ever it has to.   So what if it gets depressing, actually risk having a down night instead of coming here where you can alt+f4 the minute you start getting uncomfortable.  Actually give something.   Shit.

We're all so fucking busy with our Facebook and our iPhones and our goddamn blogs that we've stopped talking to eachother face to face.

That's what we have to look forward to, a future filled with people absorbed in their own bullshit.   

I don't want to live in that world.

Fuck everyone who's ever seen someone who needed help and didn't reach out.

Fuck everyone who ever stepped on someone else for personal gain.

Fuck everyone who's ever hated someone just because they were different.

Fuck my parents for bringing me into this shithole.

"I don't think i'll kill myself over this but this will definitely up the chancesHi /r/SuicideWatch so there's been a lot going on over the last year or so much more than I feel I want to type up in a post as it could take me all day but basically I've been fighting a losing battle for a while now but small victory's are helping me get through the worst parts for example i passed my driving theory test two days ago :).

Anyway ill give you some background so you can help me with these problems, so around two years ago i was 16 got into my first real relationship with a girl named abbey about 9 months into the relationship she got really drunk at a party she got really angry at me when i told her to slow down a bit and tried to make out with one of my friends at the party needless to say it didn't work he didn't make out with her, for the remaining months of our relationship she acted extremely distant and unloving as i showered her with praise until around February last year I broke up with her. A bad and good break up at the same time as we were both extramly sad but were able to calmly talk to each other and come to an undersanding however my mother through this time told me she was  disappointed in me because I wouldn't get over her in literally two days and said she must of raised me wrong because i'm fucked up anyway.....

Between that time and now I got a job at McDonalds hated it quit got kicked out of my house got forced to move back into my house normal school issues however i don't mind school that much rampant suicidal thoughts and just generally scared of the future and sad at life. Throughout this time abbey would message me now and again and wed talk for a couple of days before i stopped as i never really stopped having feelings towards her so i couldn't talk to her without feeling like shit.

ok so here's the real problem we started talking two months ago ended up started having casual sex weekly i know great idea, said at the begging that if we chose to date people we would be ok with that and would stop this. one of my friends asked her out couple of days ago im not ok with that they went out on a date none of them told me she lied to me about why she couldn't come round and where she went. I worked it out for myself [here are the texts from tmrw to today when i worked it out](http://imgur.com/a/927HO).

 I just read through that and have left a bit out but i hope this gives the general gist of what im trying to say honestly i never fell out of love with her i don't think that's really something i can do but i know she has with me.

"Not sure what to do. My life feels like it's over.Hi I was just directed to this sub.. I'm not even sure where to begin.

I have mental problems/memory issues so if there is a timeline discrepancy or everything is mixed up I'm sorry.

I'm also sorry for the length of the post. You dont have to read it, it's OK.

I'm 31 and have lived an incredibly dismal life. As a child I lived with a single mom, she had me when she was eighteen. She had no aspirations and not much of an education. So we lived with her parents off and on until she was over thirty. Which was alright except that my grandfather never took it up to be the male role model in my life. He was extremely cynical of me, and would make me cry pretty well daily. And for some reason I'd cry until I vomited, which I believe contributed to my future stomach problems. It sucks pretty bad when you're eight years old and your own family won't believe you have heatburn. It's like leaving me there to bleed out.  I was very thankful of this when I vomited blood up for the first time due to the burning in my stomach.

By the time I was in grade two I was removed from my school due to behavioral issues and placed in a ""special"" class for misbehaved students. This was also in a catholic school. It was an extremely hostile environment, and putting problem kids in a class full of problem kids is probably the worst idea I've ever heard. But it's still happening to this day and damaging the lives of  countless children. The lax learn at your own pace philosophy they seem to have held probably wasn't very beneficial to a lot of the students. The only thing that pushed you to the next grade was to simply be there. There were no tests to pass, no work to be graded on. You didn't even have to do anything. 

In grade five we moved from the big city to a super small town, they didn't have behavioral classes, but I made so many friends and things were happy, the days were bright. Six months later we moved to another small town because my mom met some guy. We moved in with him. I made more friends, everything was OK I went to school there were no problems (They didn't have behavioral programs for students in these places in the country it seems, we moved from toronto to new brunswick to nova scotia)

"I am sick of tryingI really don't know why I bother anymore. My birthday was yesterday and it really just solidified the idea that I don't matter at all, not even a little bit. I always always help through fun birthday parties for people, ever since I've moved ive helped throw and organize 3, one was even a surprise party. I put lots of money and effort into these parties. Its not like I did this to expect anything back, its not that, its just sad when people just dont care. Not one of my close friends posted on my fb, which its just like such an easy thing. Everyone is on fb, everyone sees the birthday notification, but they chose to not even say a word. I know this sounds so stupid and whiney but its just like solidifies the idea that i dont matter. I never ever did to my friends. And its not them its me. I dont deserve to be cared about, im the annoying person that hangs around them and they deal with it and i appreciate that they do but why should I even bother them anymore, theyd be so better off without me. My mother could literally care less that I exist, she is coming home for Christmas and posted a status about how she was so excited to see her mother, her sister in law and her niece. Not a word about me or my sister. She knew wed see it obviously if we have her on fb. Not even the person who gave birth to me can remember i exist. All I am good for is being used occasionally. I am not worth the air I breath. I just take up space and time that other people could be using. I am ugly and fat, and everyone knows it. I can tell people are disgusted by me, and im so sorry that they even have to look at me. I wish I would just disappear, people would only notice because I have duties like getting the bills ready to pay.
My other friend was having a rough time and everyone rushed to her side to help her, to be there for her. But no one cares about me, maybe because i have felt bad on and off for so long, maybe because im disgusting and dont matter, maybe everyone is secretly hoping ill kill myself so they can stop being annoyed by me. the only thing that keeps me here is my pet, and i mean how sad is that. That the only thing that needs me is my pet because he has to because i have to take care of him. I just dont want to try anymore im so sick of trying and im so sick of not mattering. I know it sounds all so stupid but everyone of my friends all care and love each other so much but when it comes to me im just nothing I dont want to leave bed or my room i just want to eat junk food until i cant move and just rot away. Im so digusting and unattractive, no one will ever love me, ill be alone forever, no one will ever care, so why dont i just fucking end it get it over with what the point on sticking around, there is none. I want to end my life so bad, i feel like looking up suicide methods is so so comforting because its like i know there is a way to escape. I know i am stupid and people hate me because i have no reason to feel this way but it only makes me want to end it more. There is no help I can get, ive done it all. Why bother i just dont want to take up space and peoples time anymore i hate being a burden I just dont want this anymore. i want my friends to be happy and have a good life and they dont deserve someone who is disgusting and a nuisance in their life.

"Will someone please talk me down..

I posted here a couple of days ago, x-posted in another sub with very little response. 
I am a female in my midthirties who is severely chronically ill, physically disabled, and unable to drive or work. My condition is such that it is physically impossible for me to live alone. I have been through two awful divorces and am currently trapped in an often abusive engagement to a guy whom I have strong reasons to believe has been unfaithful to me. He is a narcissist. 

Despite negative full panel STD test results, I have continued for six months and counting to experience terrible unexplainable symptoms that appear to only align with an STD. I don't want to be right about my suspicions. My entire life rests upon whether or not my partner did something he shouldn't have done. I literally have no friends nor family to turn to for help if he has betrayed me; absolutely no one. I do not use Facebook. He and I have lived with his mother for a couple of years now and I just made the huge mistake of confiding in both his mother and my partner's sister about my fears. They are beginning to tip my partner off about my suspicions of him.

 Anyone who has been abused and is trapped knows what that can mean. I am freaking terrified now. I have nowhere to go if he finds out that I don't trust him. I convinced him to take me to get retested early next month, but my whole future rides on those results. I have no one to stay with. My mother passed away from a terrible illness one month ago and my father and I do not get along at all. Staying with him is simply out the question. I am entirely alone. Going to a shelter is impossible for me because a physically disabled person is considered a liability and I have experience with being turned away from them already in the past. I have absolutely no recourse in this situation now. I am absolutely terrified and completely freaking alone. Oh God. The only way out of this is death. Can someone please talk to me and help me through this before I make a very bad decision??",suicide

I have thoughts. I don't know why I have these thoughts, I think about why I have these thoughts. I think about whether or not the fact that I'm thinking about whatever I'm thinking about means anything, and if it does, what? I don't trust the way my thoughts form. I don't know who I am. I don't know what I am.

I WANT TO DIE. DYING IS ALL I HAVE EVER WANTED TO DO SINCE I WAS 6. I have been depressed, suicidal since I was 6.

I'm crazy. I'm insane. Let me tell you about my day today. This is **ONE** example of a day of mine.

I drove 1000 miles with no break. Why? Because I was bored. For the first 5 hours, I had these thoughts. Thoughts of murder. I felt strange. I just wanted to murder and torture innocent people. I made specific plans to kidnap, rape, torture, and kill some women. I DON'T WANT TO HURT ANYBODY. I have urges. Every moment of every day, my behavior is different from my thoughts and my intentions. It's as if two entities are possessing me; one controls my mind, the other controls my body.

My parents abused me. A lot. Every day. And the worst part? They genuinely care about me, and that guilted the FUCK out of my child self. Everything about their behavior said ""I hate you. You're worthless. We wish you were dead. Kill yourself."" and they abused my mind EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. But they love me. Their behavior is 100% inconsistent with their thoughts. They're INSANE PEOPLE. They are absolutely batshit insane people, beyond comprehension. They are more insane than I am, and I can feel myself turning into my father more and more every day and the thought that I am becoming like him absolutely crushes me.

I'm worried my urges will get worse. I'm worried I will do something unforgivable before I realize it. I want to die. I want the sweet release of death. Being in this mind is torture. 

I regret every single thing I have done in life. I can't believe I got to this point.

I have no friends, no family, no dreams, no motivations, no likes, no dislikes, no opinions of my own. I am a mindless drone, isolated and spending every second of every day alone with my own thoughts.

Please, talk to me. I tell myself I don't want help, but I do. I want help. I want to be happy. I want to have dreams. I want to make other people smile and laugh with them. I want to have meaningful connections with other people. But I just can't. All I do is send myself farther and farther down the hole.

I wasn't always like this. I had dreams as a very young kid. I was nice to everyone, and just wanted everyone to get along and be happy. I just wanted to be happy, to help others. But my parents FUCKED. ME. UP. THEY DID THIS TO ME. LIVING WITH THEM WAS **ABSOLUTE HELL**.

I'm crying. I'm a 19 year old dude. I look 12, and I feel like a 70 year old man with the mind of a tormented 6 year old. Please talk to me. Ask me questions. I want to fix myself. I want to be happy. I am going to get mental help in about two weeks, but for now, I just need something, ANYTHING. So I turn to you guys. Please, I beg of you. I just want to hear from other people. I want to die more than anything else, but a small piece of me doesn't.

I spent most of this weekend in my bed. I wanted to go out and do things but one way or another I seemed to convince myself not to. I have a good support network which I'm extremely grateful. The feeling that I have let my family and loved ones down has been fundamental in the way that I have viewed every day since I was 12 or 13. I'm now 27 (M). Significant mental health issues and substance abuse have been ongoing problems for me since then. In this time, I have continued to meet a few amazing people who have challenged my cynicism about humanity. This adds to my conflict; Do I want to be here? Is me being here of enough benefit to be worth it?  


My dreams and goals are barely worth mentioning anymore because my work towards achieving them has completely stagnated. I am no longer sure if I am capable of ever completing my university degree and making the world a slightly better place through my career. During the pandemic and recession, the government in my country has been providing financial assistance to people who lost their jobs due to the economic circumstances, I am one of these people.

So long story short I have two best friends (one male one female) and they obviously like eachother but that dosent matter rn.

So basicly I know that one of my friends was going to go into the military but he was planning on doing 4 years of ROTC before he went in so we were going to all spend college together, yay right? Well no.

Because apparently to get where they wanted in the military (Special ops and army medic respectively) they would have a better chance if they just enlisted out of highschool AND the minimum enlistment is 5 years... they where thinking about doing 8.....

Like don't get me wrong, I want to see them reach their goals and be happy and I am going to support them and I love them both SO much but its just am so scared of losing them and us drifing apart.

I'll finish hs and most of if not all of my college before they get out and that is IF they get out because... you know... it's the military.

"Hate my meds, but I can't live without them.Fucking venlafaxine. Without it I'm always suicidal, but with it I sleep upwards of 12 hours a night, and feel sleepy and unfocused all the time. Ican't get it up, can't cum on the rare occasions I do get it up, even though I've been off it for a while now. Neither way is actually living. I probably get a grand total of two productive waking hours when I'm on it, and off it I get none because I do nothing. I can't keep up with this world, I tried getting help and it made nothing better, I'm just a burden on everyone either way. 

On venlafaxine I didn't want to kill myself. I wanted to try other things. I wanted to try an alternative, I wanted to try supplementing it with modafinil. And my psychiatrist said no, because he didn't get that while I might not *irrationally* want to die any more, in that state it's a fairly rational decision. 

What the fuck do I do now? I was staying alive for my girlfriend but then she got sick of me being so tired and useless all the time. I'm just done, I'm not staying alive for anyone or anything else. ",suicide
"angry and frustratedeverything is just too much for me right now. this pandemic has driven me back into a deep depression after months of working on myself and bettering my mental health; everything is shot back down to stair 1. im not making enough money anymore; and wont be for the next few months because of the pandemic. im turning 21 this summer and I wanted oh so desperately to move out so I could finally have a taste of adulthood...I have never been able to live on my own because of poor mental health and inability to find room mate. but my mental health was getting better and I finally was making enough money to where I could move out without needing a room mate. i also am so embarrassed and ashamed i live at home; it makes me feel like a loser. my mom is worsening my mental health bc she is now unemployed bc of the pandemic and constantly at home. all she does is nag me and treat my issues as trivial nonsense and acts like she will not allow me to move out...my mother was never strict but ever since I started college she became anal and insanely strict...im an adult...
I also am having severe anxiety because of corona and everyone dying is making me upset and paranoid. I want to work because I cannot not be making money, life is way too expensive to just quit but working is stressing me out bc im putting myself at risk to contracting the virus
my car also is conveniently breaking right now which is just the icing on top of the cake. 
im crying and angry and shaking and I want to cut myself but I know im way too old for that, I dont have enough of any drug right now to abuse it...I just feel hopeless and scared and I dont want to be here anymore. this happens every time: I have a breakdown and get suicidal, get my act together and life starts going well, then something happens and shoots me down farther than I was before.

I have been depressed since I was 13 but when I turned 15 I got suicidal. I feel lonely and I think about how I should kill myself when I'm at school or when I'm eating etc. 
I almost never sleep for more than 2-4 hours per night which makes me very tired at school and I only sleep in class. 

I don't really have a good reason for being suicidal except that I hate the way everyone lives, wake up, go to work, get paid, go home, eat, sleep and then it starts all over again. I also feel like i'm such a dick towards everyone, as I don't care about anything anymore, some people are annoyed by my negativity towards everything. 

Being alive is just pain and suffering. I've almost stopped feeling emotions at all, I don't feel empathy towards people anymore, only for animals. Now at school i've just started pretending that everything is alright after someone said that I was emo or something like that and now it's just too hard to ""be happy"".

"I have GOT to stop this damn rollercoaster, one way or another. Show me how you hold onto reality in times of unbelievable events.I feel as though there is, at this point, no way for me to come to a conclusion about the validity of some of my thoughts and perceptions. Sometimes, I have a hard time hearing people and I'll just hear gibberish with certain words mixed in that give it various malicious intents. This normally only happens when I have been awake for more than 24 hours. Also, while in this state, I watch myself come off as ignorant or excessively socially awkward while my inner thoughts are quite perceptive of the body language and general mood of the situation. Usually, other people are completely confused, unhelpful, or downright mean and mocking. It feels as if some people never left elementary school.

I have been very confident in the past so I know what it is like to be accepted and to perform in a way that elicits a positive reaction from friends and strangers. This makes the fluctuation between ability to focus/listen for understanding and distraction/anxiety even more frustrating and unpredictable.

Some backstory: Never was socially adept until high school and still had limited success but that was mostly due to my lack of interest in the most popular of culture. I had a small group of friends who also took a long time to warm up to me. I have trusted people less and less as I get older and more experienced with the fact that everyone has lied, can lie, do lie, to cover up something they consider extremely embarrassing or to preserve something they fear losing. The former reason to lie is slightly less annoying than the latter and I automatically assume the person is capable of both great good AND malevolence, a balance everyone sits somewhere on. It is the latter desire to hoard 'precious' objects or people through EXTENSIVE deceit and [Gaslighting]() that has planted the seed of, first, my belief that the exact opposite of what is readily obvious could actually be the REAL truth and, second, the expansion of this to the realization that the webs of proof and science (and CLEARLY religion) are not as perfectly indisputable as most people trust they are. Once this truth is realized it opens the flood gates for endless permutations of possibility, especially using the current theories being worked on trying to define the relationship between thought and matter. I'm sorry if reading this puts you into a similar state but I'm starting to get more and more scared and I really need to know your HONEST opinions about the explanation of so many coincidences that it defies the definition of 'coincidence'. For example, I was driving a car with a girl in the passenger seat and we pull up to a light where a bum holds a sign that reads ""I need a Job and clothes"". I (clearly incredibly insensitively) joke to the girl by saying, ""Hey, yea buddy I need those too..."" Immediately after saying this a car pulls up beside us with a sticker that says exactly: ""You don't need it"". We have a hearty and yet vaguely tense laugh about the 'synchronicity'.

These things are happening more and more often and I could list at least 5 more that are unbelievable enough to honestly build a case for an intelligent force affecting reality in some way. I was not raised religious in any way and, in fact, was a staunch skeptic for most of my life as it pertains to mysticism.

I am very serious, I NEED to know exactly what you believe and **WHY**. The why, preferably, would consist of personal experiences with no alternate explanation OR that initially seemed to have no reason but was later shown to be natural. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE help me, and undoubtedly more redditors, to find some way to stop constantly taking this factor into account as it pertains to such mundane daily events such as a sign held by a bum causing a damn existential crisis.

Much love for you all, I look forward to your excellent powers of deduction. Yes, I am in a humorous mood, this is not always the case and my emotions can become so acutely anxious that I really don't want to ever feel that specific pain again.",suicide

"I could have graduated this week but I ruined all my chances... this is it for me, I'm doing itI've been struggling with depression and social phobia for the last years, and although suicidal thoughts have been recurrent, this is the first time where I feel committed to it.

I have to hand in my graduation thesis by this Friday, but I have not been able to type more than 800 words these last months. I am stuck at my parents' house because of the outbreak and they have already told me that if I don't graduate they will not pay for me to return to college next year just to complete my thesis because they do not believe I will be able to. The thought of having to drop out when I only have this one thing left makes me cry every time, as I've always had a lot of pressure regarding academics. Even if I typed constantly for 48 hours I will probably fail anyway, as I have not kept in touch with my tutor due to my social phobia making it almost impossible for me to reach out, even less when it's by email (and this communication is a very big part of our grade).

This may sound like a stupid reason for ending it all, but honestly when all your life revolves around academics and you know that you will 100% lose all the opportunities that were waiting for you after graduation the future just seems like a dark void of nothingness. 

I think that all this time I had just been looking for a good reason to actually kill myself, and right now all I can think about is how big of a failure as a person I am. Even my therapist has been pressuring me to finish my thesis and graduate and then focus on my problems during summer, but I just cannot deal with all this pressure and all the negative thoughts that have been stopping me from being productive this last year.

So yeah, I am ashamed but this is it. Hopefully I can make this stop the fastest way possible.

I hate what I've become. I used to be witty, clever, and fun, but now I'm just a black hole that absorbs other peoples energy. It feels like I've lost the ability to feel true happiness. I feel like my life ended when my childhood ended. Everything I did after childhood were just failed attempts at feeling good again.

  


Lately, I just lie in bed and stare at the ceiling every night, until a thought comes across that hits a sensitive spot. Then, I have an emotional breakdown and lose control for a moment. I get the urge to physically punish myself. Sometimes, I take a sharp knife and blindly cut around on my leg. Sometimes, I grab a bottle of trichloroethylene and inhale that until I pass out, although it has nearly killed me once in the past. After a while, the emotions pass on, and I go back to feeling empty and doing nothing, until the cycle repeats. I've lost interest in all the things I liked to do. Nothing brings me joy anymore. The only times I still feel good is after a ridiculous amount of caffeine or a joint, but the feeling passes quickly, and then I go back to feeling like shit.

  


I think about suicide at least a couple of times a day, but I can't kill myself cause there are people who actually care about me. I sometimes lose control over my actions though, so I'm scared I might actually try again. I've attempted suicide 7 times throughout my late teens while I was heavily struggling with drugs, but luckily I never succeeded. I haven't had a proper diagnose yet, but I have all the symptoms of bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and avoidant personality disorder. The bipolar symptoms have been present all my life. The others slowly developed over time. I have a first appointment with a psychiatrist this week. I doubt that talking alone will help much though. I'm hoping that medication will help me feel better. I probably should change some things in my life, but I can't do that as long as I feel the way I do now.",suicide

I have nobody, not even the person who shares mutual love with me wishes to spend some time with me and at least hear me out now because of my mood.

Speaking of moods, I'm in a fairly dangerous one. Not for others, mind you, I don't believe in harming other people for no good reason. My mood is hazardous to my own health.

Most days I'm suicidal anyway but most days I have some level of hesitation or disinterest in death and serious issues with pain. Today I find myself quite lacking in caution, self-preservation instinct, and the ability to care whether or not I live or die.

"Hey, Lar...[home](http://i.imgur.com/8nD5j.jpg)

Your arms were the only ones in which I was truly loved and safe. Yeah, I get it: your own parent not wanting you. After you died, Mom made it really clear I was a nuisance. 

She left me with pedophiles, more than one, with me literally begging and screaming for her not to walk out that door while they sat there awaiting the pleasure they'd take with me the second she left. Even if she was in the next room, or taking a quick shower, I was the fuckdolly.

Did you know that one of them was at me for years? Yeah, he'd kill my pets to keep me quiet. Another one of her boyfriends. Had my childhood dog, EB, for years...he drowned her in the bathtub. He killed several. Told me Mom would hate me if she ever found out that I had turned him on so much that he had to fuck me until he was ""completely satisfied"". Yeah, she managed to throw this in my face when she found out - jealousy over maternal instinct. She's a fucking abusive cunt. This was along with all the violent beatings he laid on mom and me, not to mention that he kept us indoors and isolated for years...aside from the times he was in and out of prison.

Know how all this came out? He knocked me up at the ripe old age of 13. I had to have an abortion. He was going to be charged with several things, not just for the sexual part, but unlawful confinement, too. 
Did you know that Mom always treated me like a nuisance, even before the pedos...telling me that she wished I'd never been born, screaming, ""Are you fucking retarded?!"" if I did something kids normally do, such as accidently tipping my juice over at breakfast or took too long doing dishes. Enter her violent blowups, slaps, punches, being dragged around by my hair while she screamed visciously. Bitch loved to slam her fist between my shoulder blades when I didn't even see it coming. I lived in constant fear in childhood. I acted out...not knowing how to relate to others, alienating my peers at school. No friends...the girl everyone scorned. There was no comfort when I was told ""No one likes you!"" with such vehemence that it still burns in my memory to this day. You have no idea how this has isolated me...fuck people. Not going anywhere near them. Isolation is my greatest defence. When you have it drilled in your head that you're unwanted, it sticks so deeply. It burns into the deepest trenches of your being.
Mom dragged to that fucking tiny hellhole she's from. Think that went well? You know the one...where they're tighter than thieves. I was so beaten down and shy, of course they took it as me thinking I was better than them. I couldn't even look anyone in the eye, I was so shy. The curled their upper lip when I'd pass by. I did nothing to deserve this. I never hurt any of them, I'd only wanted to be accepted. It didn't help that her next ""husband"" tried to convince me I'm crazy because I only knew to isolate and couldn't talk to anyone. I love my mom, no matter what she did, and I'd call him on his obnoxious behaviour towards her and it made us enemies. I hated him deeply as he was a bully, and knew she'd do anything in her codepent, clingy way to keep him. He'd told me ways of disposing of bodies and not get caught...told me he would have killed my mother once if I hadn't walked in the room. He'd sliced up the mother of his son to the point that he'd had served time in a criminal psch ward, and arrogantly defended his actions, going on about how she deserved it and how much he hated her. Whenever he didn't like someone, his first comment was that ""there was something wrong with them in the head"". Holy fuck...pot calling the kettle black or what, eh?There's can't really be anything truly wrong with me...I was just kicked around too much, wasn't I? Please tell me I'm not crazy...it's eaten away at me for years. I know rationally I'm not crazy, but this fucking neurotic bullshit eats at me. I was truly happy when he died...he was evil. I'd rather have O'brien and the other pedophiles than him. Fuck, everyone thought he was so ""nice""...good old ""uncle rick"". Piece of motherfucking shit...even his corpse is a waste of space.
Did you know that mom got a lot of money from criminal injuries when you died? She was supposed to save it for me, but spent it on herself, a house and her boyfriends. I was lucky to fucking eat, or get rags from fucking thrift stores for clothes. She still gets cheques each month while your grandkids sit in poverty. I took out student loans trying to make something of my self and the debt of it is fucking crushing. I nearly finished my degree, but trying to make it on my own with the kids too soon after birth nearly killed me. Postpartum depression and the stress of it all, I've tried to be strong.  The kids dad left even before your grandaughter was born. I gave birth to her, going to university full time and still made the first year winning a scholarship. I struggled against depression best I could, but I dropped out three times over the years, each time summoning stubborn strength to meet the goal of graduating. Three strikes, I was out. No more access to means to finish. No jobs to cover tuition, loans wiped their hands of me, understandably. My own stubborn will to try and complete blew up in my face. Left with lots of theory and all the pretentious academic terms to describe them, but not one practical skill from it all. Nonetheless, you grandkids - You'd be so fucking proud of those two...hearts of gold and that sparking humour and brains we got from you, certainly not her. I know you'd have spoiled us...Mom told us that you really, really loved me more than anything you'd ever in your life. I know that if you were as ga ga over me as you were, you'd be twice as much over them. Nonetheless, we struggle...I've been so isolated for most of my life. O'brien, Mom, that hellhole she dragged me to, settling for the prick of a biological father and more isolation trying to raise the babies in a two bedroom apartment for years, not a soul to turn to. Not a way to reach out as the isloation eroded any sort of chance to build the means to reach out, connect and bond with anyone. We're stuck in poverty...there's no fucking jobs in this fucking dead end town, and even if there were, I freeze, paralyzed when I try to interact. They won...I get it: I'm stupid, I'm crazy, and I'm unwelcome. I am not allowed to be, life if for ""other people"". 

From what Mom tells me, you would have have stood before stampedes to protect me...I was the apple of your eye, you loved me because I was the only thing you ever loved or were loved by. Fuck, all this shit is just the tip of the iceberg. I spoke to your little sister, without telling her my intentions, and she'd be happy to take the kids in case anything happened to me. They're better off without me, I'm so fucking stressed out and scared all the time...snarling and isolating from them and everyone else in the world. They'd be better off with her. They're the only things I love in this world, but I'm no good for them. Daddy, please...I'm so fucking scared...I'm so fucking shoved away. I tried, I really truly did. I've tried to get education and make things better...I've tried to be the best person I can, but nothing helps. Please...take me back to  you. Just hold me in your arms, make it all go away. I've given it my best shot, but over three decades of this shit truly has me worn down. I can't go on like this. I need to be back in your arms where we loved each other and we were home. At the time I could afford it, I had a gravestone made for you as I'd spent years looking for your grave and no one told me that you were so uncared for that no one had bothered. Your own father...my mother. Both had the means to do so, but hey, it was all about them, you know? I just had your name tattoed on me to honour you, proudly carrying you with me forever, so you know that yes, someone loved you sincerely. I can't do this anymore, however. I've struggled and tried to do my best. I just want to be back with you. No one wants me here, I'm not allowed to live and shouldn't be. I'm not welcome, I'm unwanted...got it. Loud and clear. PLEASE Just take me back home to you, Daddy,I've tried so hard - just take me back - I don't want to be here. PLEASE, I fucking beg you...

"Today was badI really dont want to get into it. There have been a few close calls. Ive held a gun to my head and a rope around my neck but ive always failed to follow through. My coworker and I did everything right today. But we still get reamed out by the boss. I dont know why im so angry. I thought I would be able to calm myself like I always do after a rough day at work, But today just keep getting angrier as the day goes on. Im enraged but i dont know why. I know Im not going to kill myself. I know im not. I feel like a fraud posting here, like. There are other people that need to vent, I dont even know if im going to hit the post button. Other people that need to be talked down from the ledge. I joke a lot about how I might kill myself. Nobody ever takes me seriously. I make sure of that. I do know that joking about suicide can be a sign that someone needs help. I cant afford professional help though. I always ask people that joke about suicide if they need to talk. Nobody has ever taken me up on my offer but I do hope that they would come to me if they needed to. 

My biggest fear is that some day I might kill myself on accident. When I have that gun to my head I may be so enraged that I just pull the trigger and then nothing. I dont want my parents to find me. I really dont want to die. I dont. And I think I have my emotions under enough control to not do anything stupid, I thought at least. I am not going to kill myself.

"I hate my health...I'm 20 years old, male, and I've got problems.  I grew up in an abusive family, and I'm still living here.  I'm about to postpone college so I can move out, but those are little things.

My health has been failing for the past several years.  I've developed a shit ton of food allergies... I can barely eat anything, and with what little I can, it's impossible to get all the vitamins needed for my body to function correctly... and that leads to even more problems, and it's alot more than you might think at first... The list of things I can eat is literally shorter than the list of things I can't.  Even trace amounts of food that I can't have will trigger a response.  If someone drinks out of something, then kisses me, I'm screwed for about 2 months.  At first, I'll be in pain.  The other symptoms are almost like having the flu, and then I'll be extremely tired.  Sometimes I'll pass out one day, and wake up two days later.  I'll be very tired like this for about a week to a month.  The pain will last a day, sometimes more, but it's the more visible effects that get to me the most.  The skin on my face will explode into pimples and my entire face will be covered with a red rash.  This is the part that lasts for about 2 months... I've been to 4 different allergy doctors, a dietitian, and a dermatologist, and none of them could help me.  The longer I avoid the foods, the worse the responses seem to be... and they're almost inevitable.  If a dish isn't washed well enough, I'll react to it.  If a knife was placed on a counter, I'll react to whatever it's used to cut.  Lots of fruits are covered in a corn based wax, which I react to, and even companies that I'm used to buying canned tomatoes or anything as basic as that will switch their ingredients before they switch the class, then there goes 2 months of my life.  If I react to something 1 out of every 100 days, then 60% of the time, I'll have to deal with these symptoms.  On top of that, I'm also diabetic.

It doesn't end there either.  If I get sick, it usually lasts about 5x-10x longer for me than for other people because my immune system is focused on tracking down pollen and food particles; so it doesn't invest anywhere near as much resources to fight bacteria and disease as a normal person's would.  I'd give more information, but I'm already pretty identifiable as it is.

Lately, I've been really losing touch with reality... my problems are so unrealistic, I question them myself sometimes, but they've consistently proven themselves to be real....  I've held a gun to my head 3 times since december, but I've been too pussy to pull the trigger...  I heard of a cure that might work, but it's illegal in the U.S. and costs over $3k, and my parents refused to fund it, even though they buy and rent out houses for a living... she rubbed it in my face too.... I'm really not sure my sanity will last long enough to get there myself.

I just feel completely fucked and betrayed by my own genetics.  I've read plenty of books about my problem, and I've done alot of research determined to cure myself, but again, my sanity won't last me that long... sorry for the wall of txt.",suicide

Hi i'm new to here.Idk how to use.nice to meet you all.,suicide
"I feel like my suicide would be perfectly fitting/ poetic justice
Is that the right term?? This is what I mean:

As far as I know, my schools never had a suicide. If anyone should kill themselves (not that anyone should), it should be me. It would have the biggest effect if it was me. It would seem reasonable and people would be shocked but wouldnt be SURPRISED. 
I was very severely bullied every day for 4 years by 13 people, and about 6 at once. The teachers had never seen bullying so extreme. The ENTIRE YEAR hated me and almost everyone knew it. I was the most hated person in the year, maybe even the school, for NO REASON. Or at least nothing in my control. Bullying is one of the most horrible things of humanity. 
I have been depressed for about the last 2 years. And I have very very few friends and no social life at all. Having no friends damages your self esteem in every way possible. I never did ANYTHING intentionally wrong to the people who bullied me. I just burst into tears writing this. I didnt deserve a single SECOND of the hell they gave me EVERY DAY for 4 years 

If I killed myself, all those kids would think She really did it and would say WE drove her to this and kids at neighbouring schools would say You know (my name) who got picked on? She committed suicide and A girl from (my school) killed herself! And Everyone made fun of one girl for no reason and always made a joke out of her and were so mean to her and there were always so many bystanders but NO ONE EVER STUCK UP FOR HER because they all just wanted to follow the crowd, thinking Oh its (my name) so its okay to treat her like SHIT and look down on her and TELL HER to KILL HERSELF and then just go on with their day like its nothing and now shes dead.

Then my death could at least raise awareness and maybe (definitely) reduce bullying at my school and the pastoral support would double. Maybe that was my purpose after all. Also no one would care if I wasnt there.
I would walk into our house common room and the same boy would announce my entrance to the whole crowd and while everyone silenced would shout GET OUT LARA. NO ONE WANTS YOU HERE. in such a sincere way. They made it pretty clear I was unwanted there. 

No one really cares about me. Or maybe they all care, just not enough. 

The only way people would care about me is if I was dead. Similarly, Ive been thinking.. what if the only way to not feel bad is to stop feeling anything at all, forever?

I dont want to stall too much so that Ive left school when I do it because then the school wont take responsibility and will be able to say it wasnt because of them. I dont want the wrong people to be blamed. 

I dont know how much longer I can go on. Its like a candle is burning, and I dont know how much is left of it (height) but I can tell from the puddle of wax on top it isnt much. 

It wouldnt be a loss if I died and I would actually be doing people a favour.",suicide
"I want to kill bullies, not even my bullies, any bully.I want to kill everyone who harassed me throughout life. Realistically, I can't kill them all at once without getting caught in the process. I could settle on killing 20 bullies and then myself.

Also, when I attended elementary school, sometimes they'd place me in an in school detention room and each kid was always black except for me (white), I was usually sent there by the teacher who on several occasions purposely bent over to ""help me"" with my school work and her shirt would be loose and expose her breasts.

I am foreign to US and didn't know the English language very well and my family were far from helpful. I felt very helpless and I was unable to tell any adults. I still feel very fucking helpless, and I'm 21.",suicide

Ive bought tickets for a gun show a month away, far away from where I live. Since Im 18 thats the only place where I can buy a handgun. The time delay is for me to make preparations and psychologically as well as philosophically justify what Im about to do to myself, to come to terms with my own death. Finally, Ive quit school. Besides being too much to handle, this will burn the main bridge tying me to being where Im at.

Regardless of my intentions and how far Ive come, Im better off without this miserable existence and the world is better off without me. ",suicide
"I'm too scared to do it but..I'm too scared to actually kill myself, I'm scared it'll be painful and I just can't, what I'm actually gonna do is I'll completely destroy my life, I'll fuck everything up the worst way i can, i already used to do drugs sporadically but now, since I have really easy access, I'll just go with it and fuck everything up, i have these crackhead friends that have their own place I used to go to do drugs, i literally could move there if I wanted to and just live like that, I'm just done with trying",suicide
"Im so fucking worried that i did something wrong to my friends But I don't remember doing anything bad, I mean, i never ask them for weed, or money, or anything like that. I never talk shit about them. I never argue with them. So wtf?!

My friends used to always say good morning, they used to hug me, they used to invite me and even beg me to come out with them

But suddenly, my closest friend stopped talking to me. The only fucking reason they even acknowledged me is because I offered them alcohol first

And now, my other friends stopped talking to me, too. Theres only 5 people left in my entire fucking school, who I'm not even that close with, (of like 30 people) who acknowledge I exist. Even some of the teachers act like I don't exist

Some of them legit just stare through me. I can't fucking handle this again

I'm so fucking confused at what's going on and idk what to do, I'm gonna ask my old closest friend if I did anything wrong tomorrow, but what's next?

"I have a small penis, I've never had a gf nor do I think I ever will. Don't know if life is worth living.I'm 26 years old and other than the woman front my life is going great.

It's not that I'm not confident- I've read books on how to have the best techneaque, I perform oral on command. Please don't try to pass me that bullshit that size doesn't matter. I've twice had women, after seing my size, decide they aren't in the mood and go home, and never talk to me again. I've heard pleanty of lady friends talk about various guys with large ones and how great they are. ""Size doesn't matter"" is a lie made up by women to try to seem less shallow than men, when in reality they are just as bad. I think we have convinced ourselves that everyone who no longer wants to live is mentaly ill, but I don't buy that. If I knew for sure that I would go my whole life w/o a relationship, I would not want to live, and I don't think that makes me mentally ill. ",suicide
"For everyone who came here looking for help.This is something I stumbled upon writing one of those days, yes we all know, one of THOSE days. Its a hard outlook on life, but hell once I wrote it down I can tell you I felt a lot better. I post this in hopes to help you. It's very lenghty and probably many grammatical errors, but I the tears were in my eyes and the voices in my head were distracting me, so I did my best. And Best of luck to you all. I believe if you can read this and face it as the truth, you can make it through this, just as I did. Because you start seeing things as no overall point. If I were to try to put it in words you could understand it would be you start taking ""risks"" and with risks comes ""reward"". You won't even notice it at first. But it will be there.

I would have to say, to one guy, just one guy, there is no point. No point. None. I simply don't see how you can disagree, you cannot give me a valid reason to why there is with actual evidence or supporting details, you can't. I dare you to try, I dare you to tempt fate. It's simply put at that, there is no point. It's all just there, you can't put it together, you can't write it out, because if you were to try, there would be no point. Do you get where I'm headed? Of course you don't. Because I'm headed no where, because there is no point. It has been shown over and over again in every way possible, people are just to blind to see, that they put words to it to try and make sense. But yet, there is none. No sense. There is nothing this world wouldn't give, to fill it with sense. To give it a point. There is no knowledge, there is none. How can you possibly say you know, when you yourself haven't known before. Can you just simply believe it, because they tell you so? There is no knowing, there is no point. I'll try and put it into terms that we have all agreed upon, and believe it to be real. It's trial and error, guess and check, nothing else. There is no point. So how can we all decide, what to put behind this? When you yourselves, don't know.Is there such a thing as success, or has it been around so long that what used to be just faith and hope, turned into our reality. How do you know?.....  How do you know? Take it to yourself to think. Has the hope and thought of success become something, the one thing, that we all humans agree upon? Letters and numbers. It's all just how we put together the everything, the everything of nothing. There is no point. We simply must agree that there is no such idea. How many times must it be shown to us, that there is no point. There is a such thing as nothing, and it is everything that we see. Just what we have agreed upon makes it something. Why can't we allow the thought of being ""unhappy""? What makes it unhappy, and to whom? Does that really justify what can make one happy or not? Have we just been so worn out with the fight of being ""unhappy"" that we seek happiness? But can it really be sought? How can you deny something to not be right, when it never leaves you? It never leaves you, it will always appear, and come upon us. So can we embrace it, can't we all just let it happen? Why do we continue to escape it, when all it does is return, harsher, as if it were angry at us? We have left it for too long. I have left it for too long. I will not change, I will not cheer, I will not forget that it is here. It's inside us. The only thing you have to do is look deep enough. When faced with the chance to escape it, I will, just as we all would, but I will not forget. I will allow it to come back upon me. I will surrender to it. Maybe, just maybe, it won't forgive me. 

Even now I am still holding to grips with myself and how I will always be ""unhappy"" I probably wont call it this for very much longer, because its not really being ""unhappy"" its more of human nature. We have grown out of ourselves, we have become distant with our nature, our true meaning and being, the true meaning and being that there is no true meaning to it. We are just here, and we cant accept it now. Its been too long, why oh why cant the people just see? We aren't here for a reason, we just are, it happened, so what. Live with it, there is no need to find this out, so there is no need to find anything else. Do what you are good at and that should be suffice to what makes you ""happy"". It's more of a fit in your place that you were put sort of thing. We are toys to a creation that is and forever will be beyond our understanding. We will never know, so we can just stop trying and ignore the subject. I will go as far to say as I am no longer an Atheist. However I will not bring my understanding of something of which I can not understand into my own reality that I have thus created so far.  This is something that I am going to leave alone and go on with my day, because does it really matter? Does it? Back to being a toy. We are all one, we have no right to do otherwise, we need to find what we can do, and do it. No questions. Don't think about what you do. Just do it. If you are needed elsewhere something will call for it. But what you are doing is what you must. Because that is what we have given the title, ""happiness"". What we are made to do, individually. But its simply beyond that, the concept is made up. Its just to keep us in our places, but we have made it be for so long, well that happiness has become something, and with anything that is something, there is always the opposite. We made an opposite to nothing, something that isnt there. So how can we break from this cycle? Well just remember. No feelings. Do what you are meant to do. We can think with our own brains to figure out what that is. And follow it, but once feelings get involved, you need to drop it. and think again. It's something that must be done. In order to break the cycle. Of which we have named, ""Depression and happiness"".",suicide

"I'm going to kill myself by the end of this monthI'm a 19 f. I've contemplating the idea of killing myself before whenever i was depressed on my pre-teen years, anyway i never did it 'cause deep inside me i knew it was my depression doing the thinking, not my brain. Now, years later, is the first time im actually thinking about it without being depressed. I've, for the first time, analyzed everything with a critical mind. Life just makes no fucking sense. The way the world works, is the most stupid system that anyone could come up with, im here now all down and fucking desperate because i can't get a job. Im all suffocated by the senseless concept that money is. I've been trying to get a job since i finished school 3 years ago but here none hires you if you have no experience, you are ugly or they just don't fucking know you. People here only hire friends of friends. I can't push myself here 'cause. Here's the thing. I can't talk. This has been my biggest problem my whole miserable life since i remember. I don't know how to talk to people . I can't express myself, i can't even go to the grocery store alone to buy shit. i've had social anxiety in the past, i've been homeschooled the last 2 years of high school. All my problems are originated by my lacking social skills. I've always blamed this on my family for rising me like shit making me grow up to be the selfish incapable of talking piece of shit that i'm now. I always hated everyone for not liking me. I only have one friend, and she and my two siblings are the only people i talk to. I mean don't even ""talk"" to them, i just answer whatever shit they tell me. BUT FINALLY i realized that i have none but myself to blame for this shitty life im living. I fucking hate myself. I can't believe I lived so long without realising it.I fucking hate myself for isolate me and push everyone away from me. I could have had so many friends but i pushed them away, i never did anything nice for anyone. I can't fucking think on one stupid small good thing i ever did for anyone. I never hugged anyone honestly. I've never been to a party. I've never told anyone that i liked them, I was never told neither. I've never kissed anyone. There are so many things i never did 'cause i decided that the rest of the world wasn't worth it. And now i see this things i always blamed on my upbringing and oh jesus im the only one to blame, im so miserable. i hate myself so much for it. The worst part is that now i want to change that but i can't cause i was never given the tools to do so. I was always alone. I don't know how to reach out for anyone. I honestly don't know what im supposed to do. My sister was the only pilar in my life but yesterday she decided to stop helping me 'cause i never did anything with the help she gave me. She is fucking right, i hate seeing her waste her life trying to help a lost cause like me. I live with my brother and he tries to talk to me but all i do is scream at him and tell him to leave me alone. I have problems, i'd went to the therapist before, i've had like four different doctors over the past years, but they never helped me 'cause i never told them anything, they only asked me stuff and i answered them or i even let my mother answer the questions for me. Now i have no money to go to a shrink. I have no job, my brother doens't have a job and i just can't do anything to get one. I have no parents nor family besides my siblings. My sister who was the only support i had, decided to stop helping me and now Im here all alone in the dark in my room wondering how a piece of living shit like myself could get to the end of the month. Im fucking desperate. I have no tools to face what is comming. I don't even want to die. There are so many things i want to do but i cant because of how i am. I don't want to die, i just don't want to be myself anymore I fucking hate the person i've become. i can't ""un-become"" me. i don't know how, i don't even think that that's possible. i hate living in my skin.

I just wanted someone to know this. How i am feeling. To hear my feelings before i fade. I won't send or tell this to any of the 3 people i have left. I know they can't help me. The only person that can help me right now is me. but im not able to. i gave myself an ultimatum of 10 days left to figure it out. if i don't find a solution on this lapse i'm going to kill myself.

p.s. : ironically i've always wanted to be a screenwriter but I desisted the idea because my writing sucks.. so i'm sorry for whoever tried to understand what i just wrote here.

"I have been very fortunate in my life. There have been times where I have been sad or  frustrated, and there have been people luckier than me.

But now in my current situation, I feel an existential sadness.

Im leaving the house I was born and raised in. I can look anywhere in my house and see a memory. A past me. 

Im leaving behind my best friend, a dude who I have known since... forever. I literally cant remember a time where I havent known him.

"Sick of constantly wanting to dieI mean, like most people on this forum, I want to die. Constantly. Even when I am happy I want to die. I am just sick of always feeling tired and not feeling like my life is mine. I work three jobs and am taking part in graduate school. I have a best friend, whom I love very very much, but constantly feel like I have to emotionally babysit. I have a boyfriend whom I love but honestly can't feel comfortable with; my fear of him abandoning me makes it hard for me to relax and enjoy our relationship. I have lost two best friends whom I can't seem to get over or forget. My father, the only supportive parent in my life, has cancer. My mother is a complete c*nt and manages to make me feel guilty for existing despite me knowing full well our damaged relationship isn't my fault. I fear all of my friends really hate me and are putting up with me. I feel like school just isn't worth it. I'm so busy I don't have time to go see a doctor, or therapist, or go to the gym (exercise makes people feel better sometimes). Despite having 3 jobs I have money problems. Almost zero me time. 

I want to die. But I'm scared of dying painfully. I want to die peacefully. I hate waking up. I don't want to feel this way. ",suicide

Must as well end it now.",suicide
"Just exhausted of continually feeling this way, and it's not bound to get any better.The past 6 months has been an incredibly tumultuous time for me. In the time that's passed, I've experienced the following:  
* Experienced the end of my first adult love, leaving me and my self esteem in shambles to the point where I believe that no one would be insane enough to love someone like me, and even if they did they'd just find flaws to nitpick at and leave me for anyway
* Lost the majority of my friends after this, and the ones that remained are too far away and are too busy living their own lives to a point where I've been reluctant to reach out to them.
* Almost didn't graduate from college but barely got by, and found myself neck-deep in student loan debt.
* Moved back home where my entire family experience is my father being overseas for a job in order to make ends meet, while my mother is constantly yelling at me for one reason or another. This has gotten to the point where I don't even want to leave my room to avoid her fanatic hounding.
* Got a part time job which basically puts my degree to no use. Also generally work graveyard hours, but not always so more often than not I barely get any sleep at all.
* A constantly stiff neck and upper back area caused by stress that has lead to very painful, frequent headaches
* Basically having to go to graduate school in order to pursue a profession with my college major, but doing so would require me to accumulate even more student loan debt
* Experiencing these same things over and over again and having a general feeling of hopelessness throughout my day, to a point where I just don't want to deal with it anymore.  

I'm just so *tired* and I can't see this getting any better. The idea of suicide has been crossing my mind ever since February in which the start of this snowballing all happened, but as time passed I started leaning more towards it, quietly doing my research while putting on a fake smile every time I had to leave the house and just shutting myself in my room again as soon as I got home. The extent to which I want to avoid my family is so great that I skip meals just so I won't have to see them, because it always ends the same way - with my mother nagging at me and exaggerating the circumstances. I don't have individuals I deem close enough to talk to about my worries either, as my group of closest high school friends is now all over he country busy with their own careers while I feel like I've regressed by moving back home after university and getting a part time job that requires no degree just to start paying my seemingly endless amount of loans back. I did want to further my education, but the prospect of having to borrow even more money is greatly deterring, along with my university GPA being severely lackluster because of the way I barely stumbled over the finish line to graduate this spring.  

I think I'm at my breaking point. I don't know what to do, and I don't want to tolerate this anymore. I know I'm on the younger end of the spectrum and there's the unknown that's waiting for me or whatever, but honestly I just feel like these burdens are just going to keep following me around no matter what path of life I choose to take, and its exhausting and demotivating having to deal with all this at once. I hate to think of using it as an easy way out, but at this point I really just don't want to deal with the pain, depression, and stress that I have to cycle through every moment of my day.",suicide

"Why are people so quick to jump on the pro-life wagon every time someone mentions suicide?First response anytime suicide is mentioned is ""call a crisis line"" or ""get help"" or etc. What really is so bad about taking one's life, aside from potentially hurting family/friends (if you even have any)?

Personally, suicidal thoughts are the only thing that get me through the week. I think to myself that I'll do it Saturday night and I just bide my time till then. It makes me feel relieved inside to think about not having to deal with anything anymore. Only thing stopping is me is being scared of actually doing it. But as each weekend goes by, I get closer to overcoming the fear.

"The only reason I have not killed myself is because I don't want to be selfish.. but I really want to do it.For the past 4-5 years, I've wanted to kill myself, but I don't want to hurt the lives of others.  I know that if I killed myself, I have friends and family that would be very upset and would wonder if there was anything they could have done to stop it.  
So, I guess it's good that I recognize that I have made some impact on others, but that's not the issue here.
I just don't want to live. I don't like life.  I know that if I were more ""optimistic,"" I could maybe have a better life.  but, I've tried being optimistic and that doesn't work out, either, because I always end up disappointed.
I've gotten to the point where I'm just faking life.  I do what I need to do to fit in.  
I know it's been five years (ish) since I've felt this way, but I'm wondering if there will ever be a point that I just say ""screw it"" and do it.  I also attempted, once, about 5 years ago (when I first started having these thoughts) and one of my close friends (no longer close) helped me out and stopped me from completing my already started actions.

"It's All My Fault.*No it isn't.
*

**Yes it is.**


I'm in a strange emotional state right now. I don't know how I should be starting my story.  I don't know what I'm supposed to say. But I'll try to make it as clear as possible.


My house has never been one to display much affection. Thats not to say we don't love each other, or someone is overtly abusive, but emotions are not shown very often (do I care too much? or maybe I don't care at all and I'm faking it.) As a result, communication is a major issue and it strains relationships often. Another thing to note is that my brother and I are first generation here (parents were refugees from Viet Nam).

My father never graduated high school. He began working early and came over to the states as a group sponsored by a church. All his life, he has done manual labor of some sort, and currently works as a mechanic at a self-owned (although beginning to fail) mechanic shop. Despite all this, he will never *ever* pass by an opportunity to help someone, whether it is through money, work, or otherwise. In my eyes, he is practically a saint, despite some minor flaws (gambling, which he has fixed, and a little bit of drinking). This is because no matter what, he will help and expect nothin in return. He sees everyone as being equal and will do anyone a favor with a smile on his face, even though it may end up costing him. Throughout my childhood, he was (and still is) working six days a week, from 7AM to 7PM at the shop, and sometimes even as late as 9PM. He works all day, and he works hard, even though the business is meager, he still does all he can to contribute whatever he can towards our home. Because he worked so much, I could never see him  often, and as a child, I always saw him as a kind of distant figure that deserved all my respect, but I never quite knew why. Of course, now that I have grown older (19) I fully understand how much he has sacrificed throughout the years in order to give my brother and I what we wanted and what we needed growing up. I love him more than words can explain for it, and my absolute biggest regret is not spending more time with him and being closer. Don't get me wrong, he's still healthy and alive, but I just wish I could get closer to him, but I dont know how. At all. And it kills me.

My mother was one of the ""boat people"" that fled Viet Nam, leaving her parents when she was only 15. At only a week out to sea, however, her boat was caught up by a Chinese (Hong Kong)? patrol boat, and all the members on board were sent to a detention camp in Hong Kong. Thankfully, because this was towards t he end of the conflict, they were able to negotiate her and the others release and passage to America (due to political asylum or something. I can't recall). When she arrived (living with her aunt/uncle who were already here at the time) her first order of business was to get a job and finish high school. After that, she perservered and went on, despite having limited English skills, to graduating both college and pharmacy school to become a pharmacist. Again, my mom is the type of person to go out of her way to help people, even if it costs her, as evident to the tens of thousands of dollars we constnatly wire back to Viet Nam to aid relatives. (However, she has a quick temper. And I mean quick.) On one hand, I guess you could say I'm closer to my mom than my dad, since she had more education, so I could talk with her with more advanced topics and for some reason I could just chat with her better in general, but on the other, I just felt that there was always a kind of ""barrier"" between us, as if I had some understood yet unspoken relationship with my dad that I just didn't have with my mom.

I know this is getting long, and I doubt anyone will read it thoroughly. I just want to note that at this point, I have mostly calmed down, and my thoughts are getting more lucid. However, I feel like writing this is something that I truly need to write to let it out. Furthermore, the nature of my ""issue"" is something that has and probably will recur constantly, so, while I am in control of my thoughts, I figure pre is better than post.

As you can see from my descriptions, I hold both of my parents in very high regards, to the point where, when I was younger (and to a certain extent, even now), I could see them do no wrong. Growing up, everything I did, I did it to make them happy, to please them, to constnatly seek their approval. And even now, I see nothing wrong with that, especially when I consider that everything I have now, is because they gave up on their dreams or sacrificed their goals in order to provide. And I am truly, eternally  grateful. I feel like it is a debt that can only be repaid by living my life through and raising my own children, providing them with the same (albeit unspoken) love and care that my parents have shown me. I have learned so much as a person from each of them, the foremost being the importance of family and love from my father, and the necessity of knowledge, determination and respect from my mother. Again, I cannot fully encompass the gratitude I have towards them and the debt that can never be repaid. However, this is where the problem begins.

Even at a young age, if my parents ever fought each other, or got mad at me or my brother (regardless of fault) I would blame myself. I would not tell them I blamed myself, but in my heart, I felt that whatever unhappiness that was visited upon them was my fault. And thus, I always strove to do as they told and avoid upsetting them.This worked fine, until I'd say starting about 5 or 6 years ago, when family issues began cropping up.

As I mentioned earlier, my mom was quick to anger and had very low tolerance for mistakes or disrespect. My dad is very quiet and softspoken, and often will take t he blame, in order to diffuse any situation. (For that, respect him immensely. Seriously. His ability to maintain composure was astounding.) When my brother began to reach *that age* where everything and everyone is out to get you, a lot of fights broke out in the family, because my brother thought my mother was too overbearing and my mother disliked how disrespectful and ""americanized"" my brother was becoming. Needless to say, fights often ended in tears while my father was trying his hardest to calm everyone down, and I sat isolated trying to maintain composure (but of course, blaming myself and trying to find a way to keep the family together. As I said earlier, from my dad, I developed a kind of ""do everything I can"" mentality towards my family. I refused to become a broken statistic). The fights grew in number, and volume, my brother became more rebellious, my father began getting tired, etc etc.

Fast forward to the present. I know this is getting long, and to be honest, everytime I write something, I realize I have more to write, but keep in mind this is nearly two decades of bottled up emotions that no one has heard.

"Not sure I even have the energy to type thisBut here goes. I tried to kill myself last Saturday night. I took 15 pills of codeine and valium with whiskey but evidently it wasn't enough. My girlfriend broke up with me and I thought it was over for good but she came back and talked me through it. It wasn't just the perceived end of the relationship that I attempted suicide over though, that was just the last straw. I've had derealisation-depersonalisation disorder from smoking weed for 14 years and severe OCD for 13. The former manifests as agoraphobia and I have been stuck in a rural shithole trying to get help for it all from a local health trust in special measures for almost as long. Everyone I ever love leaves me. I seem to always piss my girlfriend off just by being myself. She is the only good thing in my life but we can't have a normal fight, it always has to end with a potential breakup and tonight she seemingly doesn't want anything to do with me again. It's my fault but I just don't know how to fix it. All this ha sort of compounded to the point where I just don't want to be me anymore, even if I'm nothing. I'm not good enough for my girlfriend, I am too mentally ill to contribute meaningfully to society and I fucked my one chance at a good deeth last weekend by taking too many but also not enough pills so now I'm just slamming my head against shit and jamming knives that aren't sharp enough into my arm.

"How do I stop feeling stupid I always feel stupid around people, except my friends.
Every time I'm with my dad and he tries talking to me I always answer stupidly like I'm nervous and it's not what I even wanted to say or I do something without thinking, I feel like I'm being judged the whole time. I accidentally make the wrong decision for myself and when I'm asked why I did it I have no idea how to answer because I know I'll look stupid.

I feel as if on the outside I come off as this serious and well thought out person but then I open my mouth in public and ruin my whole ""image"". This feeling makes me want to crawl into a hole and never come out but after a while I get over it and stop thinking about what to say. This makes me think that the reason I'm a quiet person is because I know I shouldn't open my mouth otherwise I'll regret it later.",non-suicide

"Day 2 of keeping a digital journal so I don't go insane I guess you could technically call this a blog? I have no Idea ANYWAYS

I was in bed restless and went to bed at like 4:00am unfortunately no dreams tonight but then I woke up at 8:30 turned on my computer for zoom joined my first class then immediately went back to bed. I woke up later and was like 10 minutes late to my 2nd class but I didn't care because the teacher is pretty annoying and always started the class 5 minutes late anyways so I stayed up for a couple of minutes entered a breakout room and took another like 20 minute nap when I woke up it was time to leave and so I spent lunch in bed and on my phone

After that I got up did my morning stuff then came back to start my second class once that was over I put my dog outside and responded to a bunch of reddit comments I got and the occasional text I then proceeded to scroll through instagram and have a fucking aneurysm over the among us memes I then proceeded to contemplate my existence 

Moving on I played some botw instead of doing work during my fourth class and my mom cam home for lunch brought me some food from a new local mexican restaurant it was pretty good I watched some youtube and ended my last class

I want to become a vile person that people will rejoice when I take my own life. 

The current problem is too many people would miss me. So, my idea is if everyone hates me then it will make my passing easier.

I realize I will have to go against my moral code of ethics, and have to lie, cheat, and steal. However I am more than willing to do this and beyound if it would mean I could kill myself in piece.

My second goal is now to make people who would give me the world, and make them never want to hear my name again.

"I'm beyond hope ugly, so why *shouldn't* I end it?I'm revolting enough that every woman I've ever asked out has gotten angry that someone so ugly would bother. Not beautiful women, but women I thought were plain-looking or somewhat ugly too. One girl went out with me out of sheer pity, but she couldn't bear the ugliness after a few days and broke it off.

Even my mom reminds me of it every time I call. I'm 33, so she shows my headshot to prospective girls and their moms. She relays their extremely hurtful comments to me, and I am starting to think she knows how devastating it is to hear, and *wants* me to off myself. I realize the shame in being the only one of your friends whose son isn't married and has never had a girlfriend at 33. Financially I'm good, am average height, not fat, dress well, but my face, oh god.

Even when I avoid calling home and the awful thoughts start to go away, I'm bombarded with romance in almost every TV show or movie I watch, no matter how male-oriented. I'll be doing fine for weeks and then some love interest on the TV will send my mind into hysterics, never shutting up about dying. I might even just screw up at work, and my mind will just melt into a jumble of never-ending ""boil yourself alive you ugly dumb fuck"" thoughts.

I've tried hobbies, but the ones I've gotten into all involve people, and I can feel the disgust and hate, or sometimes sympathy, people have for me by looking at me - I've dealt with it my whole life, from being punched in the face and pinched as a toddler to being treated extremely coldly by teachers despite being extremely quiet and being top of my class. I even tried religion it's too fucking hard to get into paradise. I'd join my local Freemason Lodge but that involves a lot of speaking and it turns out I'm complete shit at that too.

Honestly the only thing stopping me, and it's quite big, is the work that'd go into it. I don't want anyone cleaning up the mess so it'd have to be in the ocean. And I'd have to clean out my apartment and find a place for everything. But lately I've been caring less about that all and a bottle of some illegal sedatives starts to sound pretty nice.

Surely there's some reason ugly people like me find to stay alive? How do they keep their mind off their ugliness? Any tips? Good hobbies where I can avoid the anxiety?",suicide

"Need advise to deal with some piece of shit students from my class. First of all, we still do online school so no it wasn't physical bullying or anything like that. It was during an online class when I decided to raise my hand and read a paragraph. Keep in mind we can't enable cameras. Afterwards as i started reading it for whatever reason my voice got a little deep( this might sound stupid af) and it sounded like I started yawing for a second (it wasn't yawing). After that I cough a bit and said excuse me and continued reading it. Around the end I hear a message notification and after I ended the paragraph and I muted my mic I opened my phone and saw the message. It was a gif( this gif: [https://imgur.com/a/Uk5O4RF](https://imgur.com/a/Uk5O4RF)) and as you can probably see it is someone getting slap through his phone. I ignored it but afterwards someone reacted to it with an emote that is yawing. After that i asked my self, DID THEY REALLY THOUGHT I WAS YAWING. You may think this a stupid reason to make a post. But the person who reacted to it is one person i trusted. Also the guy who posted the gif made fun of me before, I'm really tired of it. He is going to the gym so i can talk back or anything or else he is gonna beat me up and everyone will support him because he is the ""popular"" guy. Shit like this hurts my feelings and I am a very sensitive person. I have all this rage inside of me when stuff like this happens but I can't talk back I don't have the confidence. I am the quiet kid you may say ( No I'm not a school shooter, I hate that meme) and if I talk back who will support me?. You may say talk to a teacher...NO. Maybe I am overexaggerating but as I said this not the first time it happened to me. Not  only from that person but some others to(but he is the main reason I'm tired of this shit).

"Im trying so hard to get betterTo start off, if I could only receive constructive comments and no I relate to that, I feel the same way etc because I cant handle the weight of other peoples struggles right now, because I cant even handle my own. Thank you

Ive deal with mental health struggles for as long as I can remember. My mom told me I had my first anxiety attack at age 3. Theres never really been anything bad happening in my life. Its always been within me. Which makes it even harder sometimes, because unlike a certain event or situation, you will always be with yourself and your thoughts. Ive been in therapy since 7th grade (Im now in 10th), but I definitely couldve used it sooner. 

Ive been through many ups and downs in the past 2 years, and I recently came out as transgender (female to male) which has made my life so much more complicated. I lost my friends since childhood, and then another group of friends. I stopped going to traditional public school this year. Ive self harmed, been clean, and relapsed. I thought I was doing better until a few months after I left outpatient at the start of the summer. 

Everyone says Ive been making really good progress over the years, but Ive never been this close to suicide on a daily basis. I cant deal with my gender identity, Im constantly doubting wether Im trans but simultaneously experiencing crippling gender dysphoria. Im disassociating really hard every day (Ive experienced disassociation since middle school but never for this long or this intense), I dont even recognize my face, body, voice, or even the things I say or the way I act. I feel like a shell of the person I last remember being. Even taking a step back to analyze my thinking I cant even comprehend whos thoughts they are. Ive stopped talking to people about the fact that I no longer experience a will to live because no one can do anything about it, it just hurts others and makes me feel more hopeless. Ive always felt like theres something else wrong with me that hasnt been diagnosed, but maybe thats the hypochondria. Thus far Ive only been diagnosed with Anxiety, OCD, and Depression. I havent self harmed in awhile, but its just because I know it doesnt really help and hurts those around me. 

The only way I can describe it is that Im a cicada. I have a shell on the outside that Ive shed a few times, but now Im stuck in one shell. I no longer exist to the outside world, just the shell of whatever state of being I felt connected to last. I dont even feel like a person anymore. I have no idea who I am even on the deepest level. Ive been on autopilot for so long. Ive tried to get better for so long. I cant remember a time that I wasnt mentally struggling. It feels like life will never be different for me, its like thats just how god designed me. 

Im tired of people telling me itll get better, it wont be like this forever, you can keep going. This is all Ive ever known. Mental turmoil with short periods of feeling ok. And I cant see any possible way out. No matter where I go, or where I run, the problem is in my head. I cant escape it. I can only distract from it for a short amount of time. I cant even remember to eat sometimes now. I forget to do the most basic things. I can never make decisions, so Im probably not gonna kill myself anyway. Its too much to plan and I know Ill probably forget something important. Its permanent and drastic, and I dont do well with making permanent drastic decisions. 

Im just hoping someone will finally say something that clicks for more than a few days, or Ill suddenly realize something, or Ill find something that lets me see the light at the end of the tunnel. Feel free to ask questions, even if theyre personal. Im desperate.",suicide

On my other alt account all I do is fly off the handle at people I think are assholes, but maybe it's just me. I feel like I'm never going to be better. I'm just me, and this is how I am. It feels doomed. I don't know how to interact with people anymore. Nothing is enough. I thought seeing my friends would help, it didn't. It just reminded me how lonely I am. All of my problems are unsolvable because they're not even real problems. They're just me. I need to be loved, just a fucking hug, anything, but I can't ask for help from anyone I actually know.

It really put me in a really bad and unmotivated mood for the whole day. I this legit fear of being looked at as stupid when I know I am not.

So old feelings are resurfacing again and I think Im gonna ask Sophie out soon, because something has to be right for me to fall back in love with her after one conversation right?

The main reason Ive been losing feelings for Em is that shes just been dry, leaving me on delivered for upwards of 6 hours, been distant and just seems uninterested. As far as I know shes okay, but I dunno if shes worth all the effort Ive been giving.

"I can't speak.Ever since I was a child, I've had a stutter. Not a mild one, think of the Kings Speech; that one hits closer to home.

I spent my school life listening to everyone chat, laugh, sing, whisper, but could never do it myself. I would sit in the classroom, at my allocated spot at the table hearing questions being thrown out to the room which I knew the answer to; and beyond all other wanting in that moment, all I craved was to raise my hand and answer it like a normal school boy would.

I just couldn't.

Instead I would sit there within my impenetrable silent bubble I'd found myself in, and daydream of a future where I would become an adult and have a happy life, my stutter non-existent. 

Ten years later I'm an adult with a medicore job, with some great friends of whom I'm very lucky to have. My family, friends, and colleagues all know of my affliction, but as they do not have one themselves, all they see is someone with a mundane speech impediment who needs a little longer to ""get his words out"". 

They, and I assume most people who can speak fluently and articulatory without hindrance don't understand or realise the mental and emotional turmoil it can create.  In this day and age everything is based around communication. Want to apply for a job? Sit down for an hour in front of two people and answer questions on you why you want to spend your free precious time filling up the cheeses on aisle six for pennies.  Need cancel a subscribion? Buy a house? doctors appointment? Give them a ring only to have them hang up when they think that nobody is there because you can't say a simple ""Hello"". 

Or perhaps you want to go to the shops to buy a new coffee machine, when the nice lady walks up to you and asks you if you need any help today, completely unaware of the battle which is raging deep down inside of you. Struggling to breathe, facial contortions, colour shifting from milky white to beetroot red. Being so aware of every millisecond that passes, and just before the words come out finally, you realise that she is looking at you funny, with a hint of fear.

It's degrading. Humiliating. Demasculating. Knowing that I am of sound mind just trying to get by with life, but whenever I need to speak to someone, they think something is wrong in my head and avoid me. I go from the friendly looking chap standing by the toasters to someone they regret walking over to because I ""am not acting normal"". And worse of all? The hardest thing for me to say is ""stutter"". So I can't even tell people what's going on so they never realise.

Every waking hour of my life is dedicated to my stutter. It's always there looming behind every choice I make. It's an invisible disease, eating away at confidence from the inside out until a shallow husk remains; filled only with anxiety with lost dreams and opportunities. If this is to be my life, then it is not worth living. Watching peers around you progress and move up to a better life, when I can't even make a phone call without being hung up on.

Suicide has always been in a different reality to me. Seemed too far away or unrealistic to see it properly. However as time goes on I can only see a very bleak future for me in this life.

I don't think it will be very long now until I take the plunge.",suicide

"I tried to kill myself the other nightI don't really know how to talk about this. Right now my kids are playing and being cute and the conflict of disgust for myself at my attempt to leave them and the disgust that they deserve someone better than their shit mommy is mingled up. 

I feel sick because I haven't eaten again too. But it doesn't make a difference, I'm still fat. I'm not losing weight. 

My attempt was as pathetic and stupid as I am. I tried to run outside naked in 4 degree snowy weather and throw myself into water. I didn't even make it outside. My husband wrestled me to the ground first while I was screaming like a banshee. The bruises are a reminder of how pathetic I am. 

I've been married for six years. I've been in a poly relationship with my boyfriend for four. Ex boyfriend. Yeah, look at the drama queen having a breakdown over her worthless ex. 

My husband is an INTJ. He loves me deeply but he's terrible at showing it. He's very neurotic. (read the wikipedia article for Neuroticism and you've got his biography). He's also the male equivalent of a nymphomaniac. His upbringing was conservative-Christian-style abusive, and he reacts in a volatile manner to almost everything. I'm ESFJ, I try to keep everyone happy, but I guess I'm shit at it. I rarely clean because I'm always tired. Keeping him calm when the kids lose it is a strain. Keeping myself calm when the kids lose it is a strain. Some days I just can't anymore. Those are the days we fight. 

He loves me, he works very hard for our family. I just feel very lonely and not understood. Or that he even tries to understand. He just wants the fight to stop, but also to ""win"" it. To explain to me with anger-skewed logic how I'm wrong nomatter what, in the heat of a fight. When not in a fight, he still doesn't know how to do things make me happy even though we've been married for six years. Even though I know how to make him happy. I've tried to tell him sweet things to try, he'll do it for a day or two then forget. I feel so lonely. 

At some point I'd started cutting, but rarely. Maybe once every few months, then a year or two between. 

Four years ago my husband had had a girlfriend on Second Life for awhile and I'd been ok with it, our marriage had been rocky and it kept him from harassing me for sex so much. He had encouraged me to talk to guys there too. I met my boyfriend by roleplaying on Second Life, and the connection was instantaneous and intense. We talked for hours and hours and hours the first few days. He understood me, the way he thought made sense. We had the same interests, liked the same games, liked the same themes. My husband was jealous that we had so much in common, but he was getting a lot more sex so he didn't complain much. 

My boyfriend was my social life. I told him everything, though I told him too much so many times its probably what killed it at some point or another. We moved around a lot, so I wasn't able to meet up with him until the very end of those four years. Well after he was already over me, though he always said that he loved me. 

We kept moving, then I got pregnant. He was sure I'd disappear, but I didn't. 

No one would hire me pregnant. I became a stay at home mother before I even had the baby. Childcare would cost the same as me working my ass off at part time jobs just to pay for someone else to raise my children for me. 

My husband hurried and got a job in NYC and we moved to a shitty part of NJ when I was 8 months pregnant. The birth was traumatic for me, the doctors were horrible to me and bullied me into a cesarean I probably didn't need. The new baby was colicky and miserable. My husband's job was hell, the commute was hell. I was alone all day with a miserable baby and my online boyfriend. Then the job cut everyone's already spectacularly low pay down by 25%. We lost our apartment. I had to move in with his control freak hyper conservative christian mother. (borderline fundamentalist) My husband had to move in with a friend for a longer commute, for shit pay, while the new boss they assigned when the old one quit screamed at his three person department in front of the entire office. He had sleep apnea and wasn't sleeping. He was in hell. 

His mother is a hoarder. I was crammed in a tiny basement filled to the ceiling with bullshit and an extreme mold problem that made everyone sick. I had my tiny miserable colicky baby down there while failing at breastfeeding and was in pumping hell. He would cry all night and refuse to eat and I had to be chained to a breast pump. I was supposed to be illustrating a children's book I hated. I eventually finished it but it took months and I still don't like looking at it. Talking to Seth was hell. I needed help and relief and so did he and we had none to give. We would be snappy and miserable at each other. So I stopped talking to him. My boyfriend was the only thing that got me through it. I talked to him a ridiculous amount. I was nocturnal to avoid a large portion of everyone's unending stress, and talked to him while I tried to work. He loved me then, dearly. He got so much attention and we would spend hours and hours talking and roleplaying and just being together. It was unrealistic. 

Then my husband would make the hour long commute to our apartment from work on fridays, then the three hour commute to his parents to get there around 11pm. He would be tired and angry and snappy. He didn't want to look at the baby. We would almost always fight. He was miserable and I was miserable and he was jealous. He didn't have his girlfriend anymore. It was the ugliest time in our relationship. It was the ugliest time in my life, except for now I think. 

Eventually he quit the hell job and we immediately moved in with my parents because living with his was hell on earth. My boyfriend didn't manage well. Suddenly that constant attention was pulled. I couldn't be on calls much at all. I had less childcare and I was severely depressed. My husband jealously tried to keep me away from the computer too, after I had abandoned him for my boyfriend those six months. It was rocky. For awhile my boyfriend railed against it, fought to have me back like we were before. Even if my husband hadn't be jealous, that could never happen. Not without leaving my husband, and through it all I didn't want to. I still loved him. He couldn't ask me to, but I know my boyfriend wished I would. Its a natural selfish thing we all do. I'd been unfair and told him things I shouldn't have, told him when I was hurt and when I was angry with my husband. It wasn't business to share. I'd planted strife between them. 

I'd always held this naive belief that my boyfriend would love me forever. He'd pulled away, gotten a lot more quiet. He didn't respond to everything I said anymore, instead I'd be writing pages to myself. That was around two years in. My husband got a job a new job in Pittsburgh. We moved for the fifth time in the 2.5 years I'd known my boyfriend. We got an apartment. I wanted to fly him up but money was tight from all the moving and we were behind on everything. Also having a 1.5 yr old toddler was tough, and my relationship was still strained with my husband. My boyfriend was around probably out of the same lonliness I was suffering from. We were making plans to meet. 

Then I found out I was pregnant again. A failed IUD that had been put in incorrectly. Who knows if I'd been unprotected for a year or if it had moved somehow, I'll never know. It was dangerous. They tried to get me to abort immediately just to be safe but I refused. I had to be monitored for a month to make sure I wasn't in danger of ectopic pregnancy. Once I was out of danger my boyfriend became cynical and distant. He was sneaking around on Second Life with random people, e-clubs. He still played games with me, and playing some Warhammer roleplaying games with him and friends revived it a bit. I tried to fly him up but became violently ill with morning sickness and he cancelled the flight when I said I couldn't do it. I'm pretty sure that was the moment it was really over. 

The pregnancy was miserable. My husband doesn't do well with small children at all. Baby cries make him panic and respond unreasonably, and he constantly talked about how awful it would be to have a baby and a toddler together. Even though I talked throughout the day every single day, my boyfriend was also distant and uncaring. He'd offhandedly mentioned meeting a girl but her husband had been so jealous it only lasted a couple of days.

I wasn't carrying a baby it seemed, I was carrying a nuclear bomb. It was a long, lonely, miserable pregnancy. I cried so much. When the baby finally came I had to have another cesarean, this time because I'd been sitting in a shitty broken chair for years that screwed up the alignment of my pelvis. It was my fault. 

You can't have a trip with a new baby. You can't have your boyfriend up when your body is shitty and you're breastfeeding. While family is constantly in and out. While my life was hell. At least I'd thought so. I should've just let him in. I'm practical to a fault, but I don't think he was even that interested at that point. We still talked every day. We played games together. I tried to make it through my lonely stressful life. I held onto him, and he was sort of there, but I railed against the distance that was so plain. 

Finally, we made plans. The baby was finally old enough to stay away for a few days. We would get together at Anthrocon in Pittsburgh where we live. My husband's girlfriend would come up to meet him too, a girl he wasn't much into anymore either, but wanted to give a chance. Just weeks before the trip, my boyfriend had a heart attack.

It was the true end, because when he wrote about it on his FA, and that girl from before attached herself to him. He began talking to her constantly, more than me. Roleplaying with her, doing all the things he did with me when our relationship had been new. She was married too. She just didn't have children. 

He talked to her for months. She began posting pictures of their characters fucking. She told me to my e-face that ""it wasn't like that"" and she ""respected my relationship"", meanwhile she wrote all over her tumblr about her new ""boyfriend."" 

I'd postponed the trip to October for him to heal. It was for two weeks. It was pleasant but he was distant, and had issues making love to me. He spent a lot of time on his phone. The second week my husband's girlfriend came up, and there was trick or treat and I took the kids to zoo boo and a hallow/birthday party for my boyfriend and a friend of mine. It was chaotic and my husband had a breakdown because he didn't know how to deal with the jealousy but felt too guilty to leave his girlfriend for long enough to get comfort for me. We had a fight where we had to talk it out. It was awkward. 

The rest of the trip was ok but, the second week was stressful and messy. I'd made a bad choice in timing and by adding the girlfriend. It was too much. 

At Christmas I found out that they were together. She posted pictures of her and her husband and him all nude in their furry forms cuddling together. I got very upset. Then I got dumped. I cried, I was told at first that I had been chosen. The pictures came down. We got each other Christmas gifts. 

Then they all reappeared. And he chose her. I spiraled. It was the worst Christmas of my life. I spent hours on the phone with him. The first few times were sweet and caring. Eventually he couldn't keep the facade up anymore. 

He plastered her on his profile immediately. 

I cut myself. Five stripes to numb the drowning feeling. At some point before then I'd figured out that a clean razor stored in a sterile bottle would cut cleanly enough to give me a dose of adrenaline that would numb an episode of drowning. It wouldn't make me feel good, but it would get my head above water until I just existed in a cold, lonely world instead of drowning in a chaotic whirlpool of hurt. 

I took a break from the computer. Stopped taking commissions and withdrew to try to get through the holiday. I bought a bunch of games on steam and spent a lot of time playing them with my husband. He was happy to ""have me back"" and since I wasn't outwardly being miserable he assumed I was all better. 

A month of back and fourth with my boyfriend, still trying to play games together but his platitudes wearing thin and his promises falling through again and again. Then she posts about how he had visited her. In November. Immediately after seeing me. 

I'd been cheated on in the flesh. 

I found out about a week and a half ago. I called him. I cried a little, but I was mostly numb. He didn't sound very sorry about it. I told him if he wanted me around he would have to talk to me. He said he would. He barely tried. 

I cut again. Four stripes to breathe. 

Then a few days later he leaves to go see her. He's at her house right now. Fucking her. I was stupid, I kept looking at his profile on FA. As long as things weren't being posted maybe it was going badly. Then the flood of blissfully happy images appeared. He knew I was following him, so even if I hadn't been checking, they all flooded my feed. I doubt I even crossed his mind when he did it.

Imagine if someone got a divorce, then a month later when his ex found out she'd been cheated on he starts plastering his facebook with images of him and his new gf together. 

It was the final blow. I've never felt so ugly, so fat, so useless in my life, or so alone. My artwork is constantly surpassed by others and its my own fault for not spending more time on it. The time I do spend is away from my children. My house is a shitpile because I don't clean. 

When he posted all that I went upstairs upset and sad. I was angry and tired. I told him what happened and he scolded me for looking at his profile. I snapped. I told him to say loving words or to shut the fuck up. He didn't like it, he kept shoving his advice down my throat and I got more and more hysterical. I ran downstairs. I've threatened suicide so many times in my hysteria during our echo-chamber fights, he didn't even follow. Then I slammed the silverware drawer and he angrily yelled down at me and ran downstairs. I told him to fuck off. He tore into me verbally, I tore back. We worked each other up until I was done. I was betrayed and heartfucked by one asshole and would be spending a life with the other who would never ever be able to lick my wounds, to actually care. Just fucking correct until I gave in. 

I ran for the door. I was naked. I tried to get it open but he stopped me. I ran for the other. He stopped me again. I ran a third time and got it halfway open, he overpowered me and wrestled me to the floor while I screamed and screamed. He held me down until I gave up. 

I should've gone to the hospital but I didn't. 

He stayed home the next day to make sure I wouldn't do anything. 

I asked my ex to call me, he said he would then he didn't. 

I'm not worth it. I'm not worth bothering with. I'm not worth figuring out what I need because why bother on a fat waste of air.

I'm so. sad. 

Sorry for the life story. It doesn't really tell that my husband is a good person, that my boyfriend was too... He said so many sweet things... but his actions do a lot to prove how false they were. That my kids are smart and beautiful but extremely stressful.

Some days I don't know how to keep going. The house is getting steadily more disgusting. I'm getting snappy at the kids because I want to do nothing but sleep, but I don't get the option.

"I'm not suicidal, but I need some help and advice...I really hate living at home with my parents. I'm 21 and without a job because I was convinced by my parents to go to TAFE and get more qualified to go into the industry that I love, but now it has left me over qualified for anything that I apply for and since the tech industry is small in my country... the market is empty. I apply for ANY job and I mean anything, retail, cleaning and janitorial, sales and marketing. Shit I don't even know a thing about just because I want a job so everyone can stop rubbing it in my face and making me the butt of all their jokes even though i'm trying as hard as I can. I'm also told that I can't have an opinion on anything, I tell them that they can save money by shopping at a store we have here called Aldi as apposed to Woolworths and I just literally get told this, verbatim from them ""You can't have an opinion on this subject""... i'm told that I can't give them suggestions because I don't have a family.

i also have some problems with them accepting a phobia I have where I can't leave the house by myself without having a mini panic attack, here is the story of what happened pasted from another thread.
&gt;About 4 years ago, A friend and I were walking home from a coffee shop, We would have been about 16 at the time and I spotted someone that I recognised... It was a person that I had been having dramas with at school and he was running full tilt at me, Luckily for me I was walking past my school at the time and it was open for a play they were putting on. I ran as fast as I can into the school and got a teacher, called my parents to come pick me up.
I should also explain why I was having dramas with this particular person... Myself and his brother(who was in my year) both have hated each other for about 2-3 years before all this happened. One day he stole my phone and I knew where he lives, so we went to his house and got the phone back. I later learned that his mother had sent him to live in another state with his father, because of that and now his brother blames me for it.
Ever since then his brother has hated me and now I have really bad anxiety every time I leave the house. I can't catch the bus home from TAFE because he rides the same bus as me and he gets off after me. We don't live far apart (2 stops) so I get worried that he might get off and hit me. Whenever I talk to my parents about it they just tell me to get over it because ""He probably doesn't care about you anymore"" and call me a pussy and faggot but where I live we have had a recent spat of one punch deaths and it makes me scared to be put in that position where my life could end with one punch and it frightens the hell out of me. So instead of catching the bus straight home (it's not walking distance), I go and see movies and my parents pick me up from the theatre, but they have stopped doing that because it is a minor inconvenience to them. I have told them why I do it, but again they shrug it off.
It's not like I'm depressed though, I would never take my own life and the fear actually is because I don't want to be put in a situation where my life could end, I'm actually a generally happy person... I have some really good friends(Who I haven't told about this because we really don't talk about problems) and I have made some new ones at my TAFE course. I have anxiety and it runs in the family but no-one understands how I feel because mine was caused by something other than just thoughts and it seems like they quite frankly don't care. I don't want to talk it through with him because I don't want to run the risk of reminding him just in case he did forget about me.

So I want to move out but I don't want to live with other people I don't trust. I live off of Centrelink welfare payments while I find a job but it won't be enough for a decent living out of home especially me living in Sydney, one of the most expensive cities in the world.

I don't ever swear around my parents, EVER. I feel it is disrespectful to swear around people but it has driven me today to tell my mum to fuck off and say it multiple times today because of how they make me feel. So that is how serious I feel.

I asked a GP about the anxiety and stuff and she referred me to a psychologist, but it's WAY too expensive and my parents won't help me with the money because they don't give a shit anyway.   

I guess I just want some advice on my current situation and just want to reiterate, I don't have suicidal thoughts, I love life most times. Just when i'm home life drags me down when I'm reminded that i'm useless for wasting my life so far.",suicide

"Don't even care about a throwaway right now...I feel like a 15 year old looking for attention... I feel so stupid.

I don't want to make a ""wall of text"" that everyone seems so hate, even though I am so prone to them. I never shut up about myself, do I?

I have some weird issue, where I get depressed late at night. I can be okay all day and then all of a sudden I'm just down and I don't feel like trying to get out.

I have only cut once. But I've had thoughts of it for years and years. Maybe 5 or 6 years. I actually did a year ago. I was so glad it didn't scar... I fear the scars.

I don't know if I'm the only one who is like this but... I love the way it looks. I fear the scars so sometimes I just scratch myself so I see all the little white lines and feel a bit of pain. Or used to put lipstick on my wrist so it looked like cuts (for about 2 or 3 years before I actually cut, I would do this). Sometimes now I use red sharpie. Most of the time I find a razor or knife and just look at it... telling myself, ""just fucking do it."" But then I fear scars and don't. 

I even want to do it when I'm happy. I just like the way it looks! I want to look down and see it... but not the scars, they have to be fresh. I don't want the scars in case this feeling one day passes, or someone sees...

I think about killing myself. I think I'm just sucking the world of it's resources and giving nothing back. I have no job, little friends, and I almost have no where to live. In 15 days if I can't come up with the money, I will be homeless.

I am only living on my own because my mom is crazy too. I had to leave, even though I knew I couldn't afford it. I lost all my jobs over my depression. Everyone can see it. I lost boyfriends and friends, too.

I have a boyfriend now, he broke up with me once over my depression, and that I was still in love with someone else. I tried to prove to him that I was getting better, and now hide my depression better. Fake smiles are becoming easier. He believes in me again.

As for the other that I love... I wish he was just a bit different. Then we would be okay. But he demands sex and lacks any sympathy or empathy. The only reason I'm not homeless today is because he helped me out... but wasn't nice about it. Just gave it to my roommate, didn't talk to me. 

I wish we could've been just friends. At LEAST.

This is getting long isn't it? Just a couple more points...

Back to I Feel Stupid. I pride myself on being smart but I feel belittled by people almost daily. I don't know how to cook. I can't keep a job. I'm a picky eater. I'm shy. OH am I shy. I have some social anxiety. I sit in the corner alone at parties unless I'm drunk/high. I know what they're all thinking, ""What's wrong with her?"" And that makes me even more anti-social. I fear the people.

""Why don't you help me cook?"" ""Why don't you initiate sex?"" ""Why don't you clean something without someone asking you to?"" ""Why don't you know how to do _____?"" ""Why won't you try this food?"" ""Why can't you make a decision?""
I feel like I curl up into a shell when I hear these things. And then it gets worse... ""Why are you all quiet and depressed now?""

I don't want to be mean to my boyfriend but earlier I clicked a Reddit link that turned out to be a ""screamer"" gif. So I screamed. He was resting in bed, like usual, and he yells, ""What the fuck! Fuck you! What was that for?!"" I laughed about it and said sorry, but he didn't laugh. I tried to make light of the situation but he was just angry at me for screaming. Thus started my late night depression. I was just fine before that.

I just don't like when people are mad at me. I just want to make people happy. That's all I want to do with my life.

Okay so:
**TL;DR** - I like cutting but fear scars, I'm crazy shy and it makes people not like me, I think of suicide but fear death, I constantly feel stupid and inadequate and instead of doing something about it, I usually hide in a shell and become worse.

"LostI've been suicidal my entire life. I'm 27 now, and attempted to end my life back in High school. I told friends/my girlfriend at the time and they helped me through it, I talked to my parents about it and got help. For years I've had things contained, I've learned to live life. Of course there are rough patches but they've never gotten that bad.   


Lately I've been in the deepest, worst, most depressed state I've ever been. I don't know what to do in life, and I feel like everything I've worked on and gained is very rapidly slipping through my fingers. I don't want to be this toxic, awful void in my girlfriends life anymore. I'm so horrible to her sometimes, I don't know how she puts up with it. Deep in my head I hate how I talk to her, I hate how I act, but I'm so angry and upset and I hate myself so much. I don't know how to stop myself from acting so awful.   


I was just laid off from the only job I've had for 8 years. The room mates I've been incredibly close with and lived with for 5 years are done with me. I called one out for behaving insane while he was on amphetamines, and because of that he's manipulated everyone else into no longer wanting me around. By the end of April I will be homeless. My parents who are lifelong alcoholics have been admitted into rehab, and I no longer have any relationship with them. I have no drive to look for apartments, or a job, and I just want everything to be over. I'm a failure in every aspect of life, I've squandered so many opportunities. I have no money to my name, and no potential in life. I want the pain to end. I want it all to just go away. I've been told so many times that things get better, when the hell does that start? Am I just a waste of space feeling sorry for themselves? I genuinely hate the person I've become.",suicide

"sorry - 12/9/19 - 9:53 pm to 10:28 pmsome 18+ mentions up ahead.

as the decade comes to an end, i realize now that my life has always been messed up. not as bad as others, but i'm not strong enough for it to seem as small as it really is. if i kill myself at any point in time, please read this and you'll know why.

before i start, let me say, i'm struggling with gender identity as i'm typing this so let's just say i'm young and non-binary, born female.

\--------

when i was born, i had and have multiple sicknesses. none are really visible, and i'm not sure exactly what they are, but i have a very distinct scar on my lower stomach. 

from ages 1-4 i lived with my grandmother, my mom, my dad, and my uncle. my uncle was and is severely depressed, and just started abusing drugs at this point. i don't remember much from this time in my life, but it was mostly happy. he made a video/movie about his life and i was in it. there was alot of violence and i remember that in the film, my mother was being chased by a man with a gun. i've had a fear of my mother being killed ever since then.

from ages 5-9 i moved to a new house with my parents, but i visited my grandmother frequently and her house was kind of like a safe place to me. around age 6 or 7, the same man who chased my mother with a gun in the film (he was a friend of ours) came to our house, drunk, and assaulted both of my parents with either a pistol or a bat (can't remember). my step brother sexually assaulted me multiple times, and my grandmother had to sell her house. my uncle attempted to kill himself by ODing on drugs in our bathtub. some guy my age at the time touched me in places that i wished he didn't.

ages 10-11, i started feeling depressed and thought about self harm. came out to my parents as pansexual by having a breakdown in front of them. i started having frequent visits with a school counselor. another guy my age kept calling me things like ""his sex toy"" or ""slut"" and he'd always tell me about an nsfw dream he had about me, him, and another guy.

age 12 up until now. started cutting, lying to my parents, getting into toxic relationships. was manipulated into being in a relationship with some girl i didn't like. was sent to therapy. drove/hiked through an EF1 tornado, one of my best friends passed away, my step-brother was kicked out of the house and i've only seen him once since then. my boyfriend, who was the only person i trusted at the time, ghosted and cheated on me, my friend calls me every night saying she's going to hurt or kill herself, and i almost committed suicide.",suicide

"TIE THE NOOSEWhen people ask what is the meaning of their life it's because they have one, but stil don't find it.

When I think about the purpose of my existence, I only found the lack of itself. I'm not trying to find money, possessions, luxury, expesive things, nor status; the only thing I try to find is a meaning. But I found out I'm just a useless number.

I only ever cared about the truth, the balance, the understanding, being balanced. But I failed, I failed miserably, while the rest of the ones around me did not, they failed but raised or found another way to keep their living pulse going.

I'm such a fucking loser, such a fucking idiot, such a fucking stupid. The only reason I would kill myself is because of how much disgusting I'm to myself, I can't tolerate such a stupid creature like myself will ever life. Among my surrouding people, which includes my own self, the only one who deserves being murdered is yes, me, fucking disgusting piece of shit.

I still can't understand how people would ever love me. STOP LOVING ME, YOU'RE THE ONLY REASON I KEEP LIVING FOR. I WANT YOU ALL TO SEE THE DISGUSTING PIECE OF SHIT I AM. OPEN YOUR EYES, AND YOU'LL HATE ME ALMOST AS MUCH AS I HATE MYSELF.",suicide

"I never thought up I'd grow up into such a loserI'm 19, ive had private schooling my whole education. When I started getting into my teens I suddenly got ""secretly sad"". I was really cheerful and funny, kind of like the class clown, but when I got home I used to cut my thighs and cry all night. That faded away when I was in grade 11. Cause I simpler didn't even have time to be sad. My immigrant father was expecting good grades and I had to deliver.  I studied really hard in my last yr to get into uni. Problem is I picked the wrong thing. I picked architecture, I don't even know why I picked it. the only reason is reputation. I wanted my parents to be able to brag. My brother and sister are going to study medicine when they graduate. And me.. I had no idea and when I told my parents that they told me to shutup and get a grip. For fear of disappointment, I picked something that sounded great, and something that I thought would appeal to me,being the creative type. Boy was I wrong. I hated it. The first week I knew this is not what I wanted to do with my life. But I had another class I liked that made me realise I would enjoy a different course. I thought oh hey no biggie, I can just transfer right? ... wrong. I told my parents that I was thinking of transfrrring and they almost fucking killed me. They said I was quitting. That I was lazy. That I was giving up. I said okay fair enough it's only been half a year I'll give it another go. I ended up failing every single one of my classes in my first year. I was so sad I couldn't sleep. I was always afraid to tell my parents about my depression, so I never got help. It was so bad I would get jitters and I would uncontrollably cry. I wanted to cut again but I didn't even have the energy for that. I could t tell them I'd failed because I'd probably be thrown out of the house.  My dad legit said either study architecture or get out of uni. My parents are middle eastern and so they're very strict. Especially my dad. I get that they want the best for me but yeah. It's tough. So at the end of first year I asked if I could transfer again, they said no. I was put on restriction at uni for failing so much. And I could only do it part time. I pretended I was going to uni on days I didn't have it so my parents wouldn't notice.  I failed one class and passed 3, which weren't architecture subjects but were things related to the course I wanted to be in. Now, I'm at the end of my second year in this stupid course. Wasting money each day with something I don't have the talent for. It eats me up inside knowing I have taken someone who is passionate about this fields place. It kills me. I'm so sad I can't even smile anymore. I get yelled at by everyone all the time. My whole family puts me down everyday not only because I don't smile and I'm pretty mean to people now, but also because I'm overweight. Just last week my mother told me I was everything she hates in a person. Sometimes I cry so much my tears don't even come out anymore. I just want to be loved and supported. I have so much pressure on my shoulders and no one understands how bad I want to end it all. I'm a coward. I'm scared of death yet I pray every day for it to come. I feel like I'm dying slowly.

I have an appointment with my psychologist set up for tonight, the only person who knows about this, but that feels so far away from right now.

&amp;nbsp;

Suicide is weird. Some days I'm overwhelmed with the need to murder myself, other days I just need it to end and want to die. I never realized before that there is a huge difference between wanting your pain to stop by any means, and wanting to murder yourself. It keeps going back and forth and gets all mixed up, I think I'm losing my mind.

&amp;nbsp;

Even typing this feels like trying to walk through a wall of rushing water. I just need it to end. It has to end. I can't hold on any more.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

I wrote the stuff below when my mind was more sound. Feels relevant.

&amp;nbsp;

NO ONE KNOWS how awful I'm doing because I can't talk about it without risking my relationships/job/etc. So instead I lie and just say I'm sick, the kind of sick that they understand, and sometimes I even start to believe it. I would way rather be sick, sick is simple. People get that sick people can't do everything healthy people can. I hate not being able to convincingly tell people that I can't handle anything outside of my bedroom today without lying.

&amp;nbsp;

Like, if I have a migraine, I can just say ""sorry I have a migraine :("" and that's it, no questions asked. Don't get me wrong, I've had lots of migraines, and they are awful, I wouldn't wish them on anyone, but I would still take chronic migraines over this any day.

&amp;nbsp;

If I have a migraine, people don't get mad and confused and expect me to explain further, or think I'm up to something or being passive aggressive or snotty. ""I just can't go. Wish I could, but I have a migraine."" Simple as that.

&amp;nbsp;

People feel compassionate and understand your pain when you have migraines. They bring you food and worry about you and hope you feel better soon. I wish there was something I could say that would incite that level of understanding with people when I'm having a bad day because of mental health reasons.

&amp;nbsp;

With this, at best they get uncomfortable and quiet. More likely they get confused and put off and start to distance themselves from you unless you make it up to them somehow. You owe them if you unload this shit on them.

It's not fucking fair.

The surgery was to correct an overbite, however she feels her jaw now looks like a man. Shes also having an identity crisis because she just doesnt look like her. She cant stand to look at herself and She covered up every mirror in the house. She has guilt that she spent 19000 CAD on something she hates. She regrets the surgery so much. A reversal surgery is an option, however the soft tissues may never go back, she risks losing feeling in her face and its not guaranteed to look like her again. It will also cost another 9,000 CAD.

3. Tried to cut herself
4. Ordered helium online to gas herself
5. Bought a hose to attach to her exhaust and feed in through her car window. 
6. Swallowed 100 pills. All of her medications. This one happened today. 

Every time its been a miracle she hasnt died. Every time we bring her to the hospital she is let out within 24 hours. The longest she stayed was a week. Its really tearing our family apart as none of us know how to handle any of this. Im so afraid shes going to die. I live every day in complete fear that any phone call I get is the one where they tell me shes gone. Im doing everything I think I can to make her want to live. Im struggling with the weight of it. Im so lost. How can I make the doctors keep her in there for longer than a day? I feel so guilty over this. If Im doing enough. If Im doing the right things. The only times Im not panicking is when shes in the hospital because I know shes safe.

Please help me. How do I help her? Why is she always being discharged?",suicide

I really want to improve our sibling relationship and i try to do nice things for him and speak more kindly to him but he just doesnt want to be nice i guess. he thinks he is a lot nicer than he really is, and thinks that he does most of the work around the house even though hes gone all day at school(the rest of my siblings are homeschooled).

"I think I just made suicidal gesture?Okay, 

So I'm in grad school and it really sucks. I'm really not into the idea of going into academia, but I don't want to quit, I love my discipline and, let's be real, I have nothing else going for me. That said, I can't stand my peers or the faculty, I feel like an idiot most of the time and I cannot get excited about the prospect of taking this any further, given the cost.
I got into a language program that would be great for my CV, but financially speaking, I just can't afford to support myself through the summer. Outside of loans I'm on a shoe string budget as it is and this would ruin what little of my own money I have left. I tell my adviser this and she tells me in so many words that if I don't do this, I will not get my degree. My adviser has been really absent through the degree process and hearing this is really disillusioning.
I have no clue what to do. I don't want to give up my degree, but I really, really HATE my program. If I stay, I'll be miserable, if I go, I'll hate myself for quitting. I know what your thinking, but transferring in grad school is easier said than done. 
Last night, I got into a really big argument with my parents. It wasn't so much about what decision I was going to make and more about the fact that I need to lighten the fuck up and take responsibility for myself. A few hours later, after I got done studying, I was really upset.  I was thinking that I had made an irreparable mess out of this situation and that there was no way out of it. So, I took my belt off, fastened it around my neck, tied it to a rack in my closet, not one high enough off the ground to hang myself and just sat there. I considered tightening the belt enough to try to cut off circulation to my head, but either I didn't think it would work or I chickened out. I don't really know which it was. I took it off and just went to bed.
So, I guess my question is, did I just make a suicidal gesture and what should I do about it? I don't want my parents to worry about me/I don't want to deal the embarassment of any potential fallout from telling anyone about the situation. But, I also don't think  this is something I should brush under the rug.",suicide
"Please just let it be overAlright time to vent because Ive been bottling shit up for weeks and I have no one that I trust in my life to talk about at least not anymore. If youre here for coherent thought probably not going to find it here. 

I seriously dont even know what Im doing anymore Ive been scraping through university I actually have more fails then passes at this point and Im in my second year. Pretty sure Ive failed every subject this semester and I didnt need to. But I cant help myself Im self-sabotaging I destroy my life every single fucking time I get it back on track. Every time.  

Finally got a great bunch of friends is that what you called them? I think more of them are acquaintances. The one friend I thought would have my back when shit got rough didnt well no surprise there so much for equality. If she has a problem I was always there for her to talk to but when Im spiralling into a dark place is she ever there for me? No of course not why would she be Im obviously not worth the time so fuck her and her friendship. Im your close friend when I need support but if you need it Im not even going to try and talk to you. Seriously fuck friendships Im so done. 

So Ill probably fail this course no surprise I dont really have the personal aptitude for university or this career path but then what sure failing university isnt the end of the world but I think it should be at least for me. The thought of existence without purpose drives me crazy if I fail what am I supposed to do? Go find some shitty as job so I can pay bills to live a mundane existence alone? Why fucking bother Id rather just go kill myself and if it comes that point I think I might actually have the balls to pull it off. Ive always been a coward because theres always some glimmer of hope but fuck it I dont care anymore everything I do is pointless. 

I just spent two weeks ignoring the world and now Ive re-emerged I know every I knew thinks of me differently. They dont know what its like judgemental ass-holes getting everything in life handed to them on a silver platter. 

I just want it to end this life of mine its not worth enduring any longer all is for naught.

"Most days my brain is just silently AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIt's like this indescribable emotional pain mixed with an intense, almost overwhelming desire for life to end all resulting in a feeling as if there's a corner of my brain just screaming endlessly.

**TL;DR** **Shoutout to everyone here trying to get on with life with a brain that wants to die**

Posting here because I can't act anymore. I can't pretend that everything is okay. I've gained 6kg in a week from eating rubbish which is super yuck, but I also don't care because my brain has been swamped by intense suicidal ideation and if I'm not sufficiently distracted the thoughts about suicide come back in like BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM just drowning out everything else. 

I think about self harming a lot. I mean, not only suicide but other forms of physical pain. But then I remember I've got way too many scars already and additional scars and a high pain tolerance doesn't change anything.

I don't have a good reason to want to die. There's no major crisis. The relationship breakdown was over 4 months ago and I'm mostly over that. I have enough money for everything I essentially need. Sure, I'll probably need several more major operations because genetics suck, and I'll definitely need a double mastectomy at some point because cancer risk,  but that's not it either. It's not even the fact that I have about three friends, and the last time I hung out with a friend was in February - because,  at the moment.people are too exhausting for me to want to have any interaction with. I don't want anything to do with anyone right now. I can't pretend to not be depressed when I'm around other people anymore. It takes all of my energy to pretend to be normal and smile and laugh at work, and I know I don't do a very good job at that as it is. 

It's not really any of that. I just don't care anymore. About any of it. Any of life. I am amazed I have been together enough to do things like shower and brush my teeth and pay bills and work 3 days a week. Do look pale and run down as shit though. Going through the motions, I guess, while my brain is screaming I want to die all the while. 

It's gotten to the point where I'm thinking about suicide all day, every day. I suspect it's the general anaesthetic I had from a colonoscopy in May sending me off the deep end into post-operative depression, but also the general state of the world. 

Now, I know if I stopped eating crap and did more exercise and got more sunshine and made more of an effort to be social I'd probably feel better. But it also gets to a point where you cannot bring yourself to do any of that, because just getting dressed and maintaining basic personal hygiene is a mammoth achievement. So, I am going to my GP on Monday to ask to go back on antidepressants. It might be a complete waste of time and money, as it has been in the past, but I can't help hoping that this time will be different, that this time maybe we'll try a different drug that might actually give me the capacity to overcome the intrusive suicidal thoughts and do the exercise and the things I know I need to do for wellbeing.

Also going to see the psychologist on Monday. It's been difficult to get an appointment (a) because it's bloody expensive and (b) because a huge chunk of the general population are under huge stresses so she's super busy and hard to get into. I'm hoping I have the money to continue to see her because she's the best psychologist I have ever seen. I haven't kept it up because of financial stress, and my mental health has suffered as a result. But I think this time I should be able to stick with it for a while.

It's been hard because the depression has screwed with my cognitive function and sleep again too. I can't concentrate for more than 2 seconds. I'm agitated and drowning in anxiety all the time. I go to sleep late and wake up early whether I like it or not. I can't remember anything and everything takes me ten times longer to process or understand than usual, and I constantly feel as dumb as a rock. 

I wasn't entirely honest with my doctor last time I went because I didn't want to be on antidepressants again, and I sure as hell didn't want to run the risk of being put in a mental hospital again. But at the moment it's gotten to the point where I just don't care about anything anymore, so might as well be totally upfront.

I think I'm too lazy to actually kill myself. Having been there and tried that more than once, getting it right takes a lot of planning and organising and logistics I just don't have the energy for. Especially because were I to go through with one of the plans for suicide I have, I don't want to leave all my stuff just around for my family to deal with. I'd need to sort out my belongings and affairs etc etc etc and make sure I had enough money to cover any potential funeral or medical expenses if I fucked it up.

And that's the nub of it. Human beings are both incredibly resilient and incredibly fragile creatures. I think what keeps me going at times like these is that I know if I failed suicide where I was left half brain dead and still aware, that that would be a fate far worse than this. My life could be 100,000x worse than it currently is, no doubt. But knowing that doesn't change that incessant suicidal impulse blamming it's way across my brain.

I just wanted to put this out there because I needed to tell someone how I feel right now with completely honesty. And maybe someone else will resonate with how I feel right now and it might help them feel they're not alone.",suicide

I struggled with suicidal thoughts throughout my entire college years. I studied medicine in Germany and work as junior cardiologist in a challenging top tier university research hospital here in Germany.

I am getting bullied by my colleagues and mentally tormented. I failed at many research projects and get bullied heavily because of this. I am 26, have no social interactions besides going to work and the gym. I have no friends, never had a girlfriend or any kind of physical contact to the opposite sex. The worst part is my work and all my failed projects. I just do not enjoy life. I know that many people here are in worse and more precarious situations, but I do not want to exist.   
I hate every moment. The only reason why I am living is my family and brother. I do not want them to feel sad when I die.

"""Suicide is selfish"", ""permanent solution to a temporary problem"". Bullshit.I have heard these for years. It drives me fucking insane. I find it amazing people don't see the blatant hypocrisy.

They think it is selfish for someone to kill themselves, and put their family through pain. But somehow, they don't see it as selfish that they expect someone who is suffering to keep living so that their family or friends don't have to suffer through the loss.

Like really, as if it is isn't enough of a shitty deal to be depressed and suicidal, they have to stick you with the guilt of being selfish for wanting to just be done with it all. Unreal. And I'm the selfish one?

Oh, and my other favorite. ""Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem."" Yeah, ok. Spoken like someone who has no idea what chronic depression is like. There is nothing temporary about it. It is forever. You might get some brief breaks from it, but it's never gone for good. ",suicide

"The inertia's finally running outI've spent the last 2 or so years suppressing my desire to kill myself, to finally die and not have to deal with any of this shit anymore, and I don't even know why. I don't know why I've kept going until this point, other than the fact that I'm too poor to buy a gun. I dream about it. I fantasize about it. It's the only remaining thing I have to look forward to- my job is a dead end, I'm not going to college, I have no real friends, nothing to make me want to stick around. I'm beyond the point where this is just a quick escape from a bad situation- my life has been shitty and pointless for years now and I'm sick of coasting along just because I can't bring myself to do anything else. I'm unwilling to put the time and effort into spending years in college to maybe change something, or to try and find a new shitty job that pays just as little that amounts to nothing more than a change of scenery, or to find someone to talk to about this to try and hear them explain why my life is a precious thing I shouldn't waste or some shit like that.

"I don't know how to carry on right nowIm 29, living in the UK.

A small background of my health conditions, just to give some context:
- bipolar disorder type 2
- severe anxiety
- obsessive compulsive disorder (which I'll explain a little)
- emotionally unstable personality disorder
- hyper mobility syndrome
- ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)

My diagnoses mean that I really don't and cannot function normally. I did for so long, forcing everything into a bulging box, taping it shut and hiding it under the bed. 

Then I got made redundant from a job that I enjoyed and was good at. Very good at. It was a call centre admittedly, but I really enjoyed it. I made some brilliant friends, including someone that ended up being my best man and I really do consider him a very good friend. Through him, I have met other friends, plus someone who understands the shit that I am going through.

I ended up having to take a job that sucked. A lot. It was the beginning of the opening of that box. It was slowly being pulled out from under the bed. I was treated like shit. I had no sick pay, so when I needed the time off when I was having a bad MH day, I was financially fucked. I was working full time, looking after my wife and we struggled a lot. Not as bad as some, but my god it was hard. The job was complicated and my MH (which we later worked out was my ADHD) just compounded matters greatly.

I ended up getting another job! HUZZAH! It was in insurance which is something that I had done at my old job. Private office. Nice little family run business. Annnnnnnnnnnd that's where we hit the snag. I wasn't very good. I wasn't expecting myself to hit the floor running, but I hit the floor. Hard. 

I wasn't worried though, I thought that I would be at least given training. Which I really wasn't. In anyway. But, I soldiered on for four days, getting up a lot earlier than I normally would have, mental health be damned. The pay was so much better, no shift work and I could get a bus all the way home, meaning that no busy town, no social interactions, just iPod and a quiet journey home. 

Then, four days in, the recruitment agency that contacted me initially called. I was on the bus, leaving town as I had to collect a parcel from one of those amazon thingies, as I live in a flat and my wife's mobility isn't great, and this was a iPhone, so I wanted a secure place for it to go. I updated my facebook status ""New job, new me, new beginnings. Let's do this and let's get life back to what it should be! - feeling positive.""

I got on the bus and my phone rang. It was the recruiter and they had some concerns about my working there. The owner wasn't happy that I was asking questions and that I wasn't as good as they expected. Don't bother going back. My heart stopped, and I just didn't know what to do. I started to cry, but realised as a grown man, I had to hold it together on the bus. I started to catastrophise, terrified I was going to lose my house, my bills weren't going to get paid etc etc. Then there was my wife?! What was I supposed to do?

I got home and tried to be pragmatic, I applied for disability, I couldn't cope with the prospect of looking for a job in anyway as I knew the box had been ripped open and all manners of hell had been unleashed. Pandora had walked off with the proverbial butterfly that signified hope. She had walked off, crushing it in her palm. 

Disability came through and I was ok for a little bit, I ended up in hospital after an attempt, but I was getting better, day by day. I applied for college, am doing ok ish on my course. 

I subsequently got diagnosed with ADHD, and HMS shortly after, and I am struggling, but I am finding that some days I am falling under the water and cannot cope. I am inflicting a lot of this on my wife, being verbally abusive and quite frankly a total c*nt. 

I have been physically abusive to her in the past which I am in NO WAY proud of. If I had my way before, I would not be posting this and someone would have been scraping my remains off the ground floor of a 18 story drop. 

This brings us to now. (sorry if it seems a little patchy, I just wanted to give a little context). My OCD is at the point where I cannot stand waking up, I struggle with even little things not working, just the slightest imperfection in something and it must be rectified there and then. It also has left me having to constantly check that I have everything. Many times. It leads to me being late for things and panicking like a bitch when I cannot find something. My memory tends to feed the compulsions. I skin pick, I cut at spots, scars, anything that I deem unnecessary. 

This was made very apparent to the disability assessor, when I tried to explain things and just couldn't. I was left in such a state after that assessment meeting. I am so grateful for the person I saw for being so caring and understanding. 

I have found that very little keeps me going at the moment. I am trying so hard, but cannot cope. My HMS leads me to sometimes needing a walking stick. It's embarrassing. I want to end everything and just make this constant sensation of failure and hell end. 

I have a wife. I have an aunt with two little boys that think the world of me. I have two best friends again with little ones that do the same. I cannot forgive myself for thinking like this. But equally I cannot cope with the way my brain is working. 

I don't know what the future will hold.

I don't know what to do beyond hiding in my room with my laptop and my iPod trying to simulatenously distract myself from myself and hide myself from everything else.

"Valar MorghulisWell, I don't even know where to start. I'm not here for you to say me ""Don't do it"", ""We will miss you"" and all that crap. After an extensive analysis of the pros/cons of living I decided to put it an end, as a matter of fact while I write this I'm smoking a ""poisoned cigarette"".

My reasons? I have no future, I fucked up two Careers because I'm just not interested. When I dropped the first one I had the chance to study a new thing in the same university, but I recently screwed that too. I don't know, I'm just lazy, I prefer playing PC games even through I know is wrong, I just can't help it and it's killing me... Basically wasted my parents money and they will be very dissapointed.

I know they love me, I love them and I'm sorry they'll have to suffer my death. But I just can't stand it, here in my country without a degree you'll never win over 400 dollars/month (half the money to survive).

"My final goodbyeIts come to my realization recently there is an almost zero chance that I will ever have the life that Ive been trying to manifest for the last decade and Im simply not okay with that. Im no closer to success today than I was 20 years ago and Im not going to spend the rest of my life hoping and praying and visualizing that a life that is tolerable will somehow magically happen to me. Its become painfully clear that visualization is bullshit. I am so tired of struggling. Always having nothing. Ive been in debt literally my entire adult life. Even with two bankruptcies I cant seem to get my shit together. Every time I try something new to dig my way out it goes to hell. Constant repeated failure really is no longer acceptable to me. I will no longer live with debt that cannot be erased regardless of what I do to try - Im so tired of the overwhelming stress that comes with that - Its been literally my entire fucking life. I dont remember a time that I wasnt in debt and I dont remember a time that I havent been stressed about finances. It seems as though that the universe has decided, without me, that I am not allowed to be successful financially because literally nothing works out for me regardless how much I want it or how hard I try for it.  
About a year ago I had what I would call a spiritual awakening. A realization that we are all connected and that our consciousness is eternal but our time here on earth is only temporary. I believe we choose our lives before we get here and everybody has a mission that is spelled out before were born. The bonds we create on earth are actually created long before were ever even conceived. We all have a pre-destine mission in life and the universe will push us in a the direction we need to go but we are given free will in order to achieve your life mission. Ive had a lot of amazing opportunities in my life, many of which I have completely fucked up beyond what I can ever recover from. Ive done stupid things, said stupid things and Ive hurt people that I was supposed to walk this life with. Its unfortunate because I know I could have achieved great things with the right partner and proper support. I just got tired of waiting and too proud to ask for more help at this point. 
Time for a reset. 
Please also know that there is absolutely nothing that anybody close to me couldve done to prevent this - literally nothing - so you have absolutely no reason to feel bad or have any thought of I shouldve or couldve or wouldve done something had I only known how bad he was. 
Im so sorry to my family and friends and mostly my nephews. I promise that no matter what I will always look out for all of you from the other side.

PS please do NOT have a funeral for me. I dont want anyones money spent on a ridiculous party to celebrate a failed life. Also, I wouldnt bother dealing with the CRA or the bankruptcy.

"I am not sure what I expect out of sharing this.
  Anytime I have reached out in a moment of deep despair to our community through the various subs all the beautiful people rush forward and try to help which I appreciate immensely.  However, even if I am alleviated of the pain of my existential issues, the issues themselves remain.  So I have found myself in a moment with less emotional intensity and may be better equipped to rationally examine this.  I have been VERY careful not to discuss this with most people because I fear disrupting their foundation upon which all the good things rest (ideals, dreams, goals...etc).  If I am to progress past this low point in my life, I absolutely need to approach the issue from all angles here.  I am not great with structuring these things sometimes, so please forgive me.

  Of all the lingering elements from my past that still bother me, the foremost amongst these is my endless source of **self-loathing** and my issues being invested in this world, in this life.  While discovering I was trans finally gave me what I needed for decades, the knowledge of what I am, everyone is aware that 'it can get worse before it gets better'.  I rode most of these waves rather well, I believe, considering all that has to be unpacked, disposed off and the healing that must occur.  But I think these two things I mentioned keep coming back to bother me.  

  How can I stop hating myself (if I even should!)?  I have felt this and fed this since middle school, about twenty years ago.  While life has occasionally distracted me from this omnipresent fact, this is part of the poison that seeps into the well.  I have tried creating positive feedback loops with proper self-talk and productivity, revising my mental narrative and outright ignoring those thoughts and feelings and focusing elsewhere.  I have seen therapists and I am familiar with their tools.  But this is DEEP and implacable.

  Next, as with many of us on this path, I managed to **survive by escaping** this world.  For me that meant graphic novels, standard novels, gaming and eventually substances.  Some people think I am strong, but I only managed to endure by being mindful of putting one foot in front of the other while dreaming of other worlds, of another life.  Now, even when I try, I struggle to engage with this life.  And by that I mean to really feel invested, to DESIRE to work on something and improve something, to have the hope of any success.  I have always felt like I have been a person that just 'was not there'.  

(Warning for others that are older, harsh thoughts for my age ahead)

All of this is exacerbated by getting older.  Its a feeling like waking up from a coma in a house that is literally falling apart around me.  Having to struggle to get my life on track fighting with the momentum it has taken on and maintaining (without any hope of actually improving really) my body and appearance is just devastating.  I was better of not caring at all.  Who is out there for me?  What is there at all at this point?  Acceptance?  Surrender?  Just making it through and surviving?  Those sound like compensation prizes, like an achievement worth little to no value.  I have focused on goals, ran upon the hedonic treadmill, and behind every thought is...**why?**  My moment basking in the warmth of my trans epiphany has faded, and I am left with the harsh reality of picking up whatever pieces I can find and seeing their value.  And for me, I see none.  

I am weak, I am afraid, and I am a burden to my family and friends.  I have broken hearts when I was lost and made so many mistakes.  I just want rest, please....I just want to not be me anymore.  I do not think kind sentiments will do much anymore.

"Difficult thoughtsSo, I'm in one of my crisis and just came across here while trying to find something to get my mind off of everything. So I guess I'll just post away and hopes it helps a bit.  


So, I had a friend. She commited suicide in 2012, and I got to know only in 2013. I was in my last year of high school when I discovered, and I had a fight with her. Stupid reasons, really. Mostly not agreeing on stuff that really wasn't important. When I tried to talk to her again to apologize, or something, I got the news. It was heartbreaking, and I wish I could have done something, anything. I mean, we were both pretty alone at... life really. And just like that, a person that was one of my only friends was gone, just like that. Nothing I could feel other than the pain it left, that I could never talk to her again. That all I have now is fucking memories.  


So, you'd think, due to my experience, that I'd learn something. I don't know. But even all those years later I just did not forgive myself. I'm not particularly alone, and I KNOW there are people that care. That they are with me, and all that. Still, even when people say that I'm worth it or whatever, I can't seem to believe it. All that comes through my mind is how much I fucked everything up for basically nothing, and how nothing I could ever do would revert that. It's so stupid, but yet, every once in a while, it becomes so heavy and I just don't know what to do. I think that I'm not worth it. That it'd be better if everything came to a stop. But yet, I do believe in the words of the few people that say they care, no matter how hollow they seem when I think about it. Basically, yeah, I don't know. Honestly, I just feel like utter shit, and usually I tank this shit alone, as I've always did. And I see where it takes me. I just wait and see, like the stupid coward I am.  


Anyway, I'm sorry about this. I'm not sure it all made sense, but this is how I'm feeling. this is how I usually feel when late night comes around and I can't just so something to make it go away. Anyway, I'm sorry if this bothered anyone. I just needed to let this out in a different place, in a place where I don't have the certainty people will just say that I should ""let it go"" already.

He felt them and agreed with me and said to put them in for the remaining 3 minutes... but still disagrees with me and thinks that he's right.

Well, the only thing that grew on my was a feeling of worthlessness and insecurity. All I see around me are kids my age that are so much more mature or interesting or attractive than me. How do they already have so much more figured out. So much as talking to someone in the hall fills me with dread. Each semester starts the same, Im so excited to meet new people; to finally get rid of being alone, except I cant leave my bed Im so overcome with the fear of humiliating myself.

"Not really suicidal, just depressed...For a while (a couple of years) I have been getting more and more depressed. However, I'm very good at hiding it, so the only people who know are my close friends who cared enough to listen to my stoned rants about how shitty my life is. 

Actually, that's not true. My life is great compared to a lot of people; my family rocks, I have (a decent amount) of money, I'm in college, and good friends. But there is one thing that has been missing from my life; a relationship. I'm basically your generic nerd redditor who has never had any intimate encounter with a girl. I'm 20 now, and it's awkward to admit. I have a girl I kind of like who I work with, but she's from Nepal and has a boyfriend so I pretty much have no hopes.

I really want to tell my parents how depressed and lonely I am, but I don't want to worry about me and spend tons of money on a therapist. They have enough worries without worrying about me. I know they would give me all the help in the world, but I just can't bring myself to telling them about it. Every time my Mom randomly asks ""Are you O.K?"", I think for a second to say no and tell her everything. But instead I smile, say ""Of course Mom!"", and move on with my life.

Anyways, I just wanted to vent here because I know the people here will listen. It actually really helps to type out my feelings like this.",suicide

"A Meaningless RantHonestly, I dont know how to properly put this into words but I feel the need to so I can get some proper sleep rn. 

I have no goals, Im a Christian without faith and cant find the point to living anymore. Im 18 years old and have never felt more tired in my life in Uni as my daily life drains me more and more.And I ask myself every bloody day whats the point of being here? I want to die to begin with but I had to have the typical fear of maiming and surviving.

This isnt a new question, its been haunting me for about 6 years and I dont know how to get any drive back, nor has my life improved. The coffee doesnt help nor does the medicine.

I get that people say uni and studying are for the future and theyre necessary skills/trades. But why bother with it when your suicidal, the amount of time I envision myself dying is probably more than I study daily.

Im just taking a random course to begin with so I dont even know why Im even going to uni, probably to just meet expectations.

Its not that I have no one. I have friends and family that I can rely on and I know its a privilege. But I just cant seem to find the drive to keep on going as the older I get the worse it becomes.

In conclusion I guess I wanted to come out and rant to a bunch a strangers about it since I dont know how my friends or non-family would take it

I just lost the woman I lovedMy relationship with this amazing girl ended last night. I loved her and due to having a really really hard past where I have been hurt by parents family friends and women it's hard for me to trust. And I trusted and it's gone. For the first time I've not been happy that I have a girlfriend I was happy I had her. I love her. And it's over and I don't have any close friends. She was my best friend. I feel so alone and so hopeless and for once someone loved that I'm just a dork. For once someone saw something in me. For once I felt like I was actually worth something. For once I trusted. So many women are focused on sex and just don't really care. And she was different. She was everything I've ever wanted and we are over. I have had so much go wrong in my life and so little go right.

"Concerned for a friend, our conversation has left me shaken up.I want to start from the beginning, I apologize early on if the information is not needed. I will try to get to our conversation that just happened a few minutes ago quickly. Sorry if the formatting and paragraphing is weird. 


I play online video games quite a lot. This has led me to meet plenty of people who come in and out of my life a lot. Except for one of my friends who we will call James. We have talked and played together for a little over a year now. This has caused a pretty good relationship to grow between us. We text/call each other and even video chat on the occasion. James is 19 and lives in another state than I. 


Because we have grown so close we talk a lot about things that happen in real life and about our pasts. He mentioned to me that he has attempted suicide before, but was saved, and generally during our relationship he was never depressed or has ever shown any signs that he is still feeling like killing himself. 


It all started a about 6 months ago, when he got together with this woman, they dated for a few weeks and he made her pretty happy. He often makes the mistake of falling to quickly and deeply in love. When they broke up he was very depressed, the only time we would ever talk was when he was completely intoxicated. We went through a period where he would never answer calls or texts from me even. Finally, some good things happened in his life that brought him up and we were talking again. 


Just 2 weeks ago, he decided to try dating again. He met a girl via a dating app. They talked non stop, which made him smile and laugh and REALLY made a difference in him that even I could see from a few states away. They met each other in person as she only lived an hour away from him and everything was going great. He was talking about how much he loved her (I don't know if he told her that) and how she could be the one he marries. I didn't want to ruin his fun, as it was nice to see him happy, so I did not say anything to him about how soon it was to make statements like that. 


They broke up yesterday. He had text me very early in the morning when I was sleeping and I didn't get the text for another hours. All it said was ""I need someone right now"". I felt terrible because somehow I knew what happened. I gave him a call, no answer. I text him, no answer, so I called him again and he answered, saying he was at a friends getting drunk. I asked if he was okay, and he explained to me what happened. They broke up because ""her mom told her she didn't want them to be together"". He pretty much hung up on me, so I decided to give him space, as he clearly didn't want to talk about it. 


Today, when I asked him if he wanted to play any games (I didn't want to bug him about what happened). He said he would, so we got on and played for about 20 minutes before he left to go play a different game. After a few hours he called and sounded extremely intoxicated. He asked to play, so I hopped on the game and joined him. I asked him if he was drunk, he said he was. I could tell. 


This is where it gets to our conversation I asked why he was drinking so much, he explained that he has felt like he was having a heart attack all day and yesterday. He was slurring his speech, making incoherent sentences, etc. Then he (very casually) says he wants to ""blow his brains out"". It took me by surprise and I asked him why. He says he was in pain, saying that he wants to end it so he no longer feels how he is anymore. I got more and more concerned as he spoke. I had no idea what to say. I know for a fact that he has the means and intent to do something like that, so I asked him if he was serious, why he was going to do it. He said he was serious and said he wanted to end his pain and that he didn't deserve to live anymore. 


I tried to tell him that I care about him and that I would miss him, his family and friends would, etc. Anything I could think of to say to him. He just shot everything down, saying he hates everyone and that his family and friends (including me) could ""fuck off and go to hell"" because he will be dead and won't have to deal with the consequences of his death. I pretty much was left crying my eyes out, left not knowing what to say. All I could say was ""your life matters to me, and I would be upset if you died"". After repeatedly saying he didn't care, he finally says ""do you think if I was actually going to kill myself I would be sitting here talking to you? No i wouldn't be"". 


He basically started to lash out against me, and I had nothing left to say. He had shrugged off anything I could think of to say. Right now, I am heading off to work and said he could call me and I would talk to him if he needed or wanted to talk. He didn't respond and just logged off of the game. Hasn't answered my texts or calls. It's not my fault I have to go to work and can't listen to him calling me a whore for the rest of the night. But I did offer to listen while I was at work. 


I honestly have no idea what to do anymore. I'm not sure how serious his threats were, and I have no idea where he lives, no contact other than his cell phone number. I don't know if I should reach out to his family members on Facebook or if that would cause more damage. ",suicide

I realize I'm not the only one who has had a shitty life, but it's about time I think about what I want. I can't even describe, or begin to tell you ladies and gentlemen the trauma and violence I've had to put up in the past and my current status is no better. Maybe not as violent? But the memories are still there and my life was ruined way before making this thread. I had a dream before making this thread. I would like to share with each individual's undivided attention. As I said before I've been through a lot of trauma. I have been through heart aches, violence, plenty lives have fell victim in my life and resulted into me watching death do it's part. I even was one of those victims or could've been after attempting my very 1st suicide and it resulted in me being pronounced dead for 5 minutes and that's being aided by medical personnel. I'm no war veteran or anything. I simply had possibly the worse luck in this game we play called life and it's like playing chess except I was the pawn, but that's just it? I was stuck being the pawn no matter how hard I tried to do the absolute necessary to change my life for the better and it failed miserably over and over and keep in mind? I was doing this all myself. I never had a shoulder to lean on or someone to be my side and say ""I love you and everything will be alright"". I don't have anyone to talk to and no one thinks I'm worthy enough of their time and never take me serious. Anyways sorry for going off topic, but this dream I had was a beautiful thing. At least in my eyes. That I was laying terminally ill in my bed in a dark room with a light shining down on me. Keep in mind I am not terminally ill, nor am I mocking those that are. In fact if you want my opinion? I rather take every disease someone has and pass it down to me because there are good people in this world that don't deserve to lose their lives. I know what to expect now. Someone will say "" well neither do you"" or ""what makes you so different from the rest of us""? Well forgive me for the only thing I can feel is my own suffering and hurting and not someone else's so of course I'm going to feel like I'm the only one at this moment with nothing to lose in which I don't and with the most pain. Life will be better without me and some will not understand me? And some might and even if you do show care? It's not genuine. Anyways I am sitting here playing with a loaded firearm I recently ripped off and stole. I know some will say "" we can't stop you "" nor do I expect anyone to, but you can say your worse to me and it has got to the point where if I were to recover from this? I'll just use all the hurtful things said to me as left over motivation to lead me back in the position I am right now. Take care to all of you and thank you for letting me say my final peace.

I have done everything. I have a 40 hour a week job. I exercise no less than 3 times a week. I had sex. I did meditation, even trying to join a new religion. I have gone to 3 different therapists. I have played tabletop games.

I've did everything people told me that I just needed to try out. Guess what: I still want to die. It has gotten worse. I can't stop thinking about dying.

"my life has become a nightmareTnis will be a long read but I'm very grateful for those who will read it. I'm going to start this off by saying I've never been a happy person. I've always seeked solace in philosophy &amp; drugs. I've done numerous drugs to try and help me. LSD, shrooms, tons of benzos &amp; opiates, MDMA, but they always only help temporarily. I've been depressed. Always. I can't remember the last time I was happy. I can't remember the way I was before it ever came into my life. But life somehow started looking up for me, I had a well paying job, drugs, close friends, a girlfriend, a car, and just my freedom. I had everything I've ever wanted in life. I wasn't happy but I was content and had a hope for my future.

Until two weeks ago where I made the worst decison of my life ; that was driving when I was fucked up. I was coming home from a day filled with popping pills and smoking with friends, &amp; I made the most selfish, stupid decision of driving under various substances. I swerved and my wheel came off the road, lost traction and pummeled me into a pickup truck. I was on the highway going 60. My car got totalled. Ambulance had to bust the windows in the back because my car flipped to get me out.I was fine besides hurting my neck and some major bruises. But I admitted in the emergency room that I was messed up &amp; under various drugs. I got arrested and charged for wreckless driving, DUI, &amp; plenty of drug charges they found in my car after. I'm failing all my classes. I've always had a great GPA, a really good ACT score to get me into a decent college with a nice scholarship but ive ruined that future. Besides losing my future, friends, job, car, money, freedom, &amp; my reputation. I put two other people in the hospital. 

One of them is a father. Has kids. &amp; He's been in the hospital since. He has a broken neck &amp; in a lot of pain. I couldn't imagine what I would do to some fucker who almost killed my mom because of their dumbass decisions. Ive been living with the guilt since. That I almost killed another person, almost made some kids live without their father. I'm the lowest person and I honestly feel like I don't deserve to live. I wish I never wore my searbelt, that I was killed in the crash. I truly deserve it. Insurance isn't going to cover any medical bills. I put myself and my mom in thousands of dollars in debt. We cant afford that. She works as a single mother, supporting three kids as a fast food manager. Besides contemplating suicide daily because of living with this guilt amd regret that eats me up 24/7. Ive lost everything. I've become a disgrace to my family, to society. My brother tells me daily how I should've died &amp; how much of a piece of shit I am. My dad was a drug addict who left our family at the age of 6, and my mom &amp; brother tell me how I'm far worse than him. It hurts so fucking much. All of this does. I can't bear this emotional pain. I never meant to hurt anyone in my entire life. Ive always been so nice and caring to others because I know life is hard &amp; I only wish to bring good to others. But I've fucked my life up beyond repair.  

I don't see a way out of this. I don't want one. I just wish I had the fucking balls to end this guilt and misery I feel ALL the fucking time. I can't keep living. I don't deserve to. The only person who has a little faith in me is my girlfriend. I love this girl to death. She's the most amazing person I've ever met. Shes the only one who has faith in me &amp; support me. But I can't even see her with no car. I don't have a phone to talk to her. I'm probably going to lose her too. I hate that I'm making people suffer because of my decisons. These poor people I almost killed, my family, my girlfriend, my friends. I've truly lost everything. I hope so much that I just can end it all. To stop feeling this misery. To never have to see another day. Hopefully one day I will. Thank you for reading.",suicide

"Thoughts about suicide became everyday routineThis is happening during last 3 years. It started pretty weak, I thought about suicide once in a month, but then it became worse and worse. I already had 4 real suicide attempts which ended up in reanimation. Actual planning of suicide and not such successful attempts were way more than 4. 

Today thoughts about suicide became my everyday routine before I go to sleep. Sometimes this is the only thing that can make me fall asleep - knowing that one day I will finally die and this all will end. It make me feel calm. I know this is sick. I never wanted my life to be this way. But this is how it is. 

One thing that I wish more than anything is that one lucky day I will have real opportunity to do it. When I'll be all alone and I'll be in right mood. I'll drink some alcohol and hang myself. 

P.S. Yes, I recovered by depression with meds and therapist. You can see that this didn't help. Mental health care is very poor in my country. So no one will help me. I don't even know why I write it here, just some kind of venting. ",suicide
"I thought I was ready to kill myselfI had a hot bath, I cut my left wrist and was planning to just bleed out, i thought it was pretty aesthetic how the water started to look, and how the blood was flowing from my wrists. I started to feel scared, very scared. I'm an atheist, and I accept that there is nothing after we die, but coming so close to it made me scared. Or maybe I'm just a pussy, or going out hannah baker style isn't how I want to go.

I think i'll make a bucket list before I die. There's a few things I want to do before I die. I've never eaten a steak before, I think I'll try that. I did check off one thing from my bucket list today now that I think about it. I think I'll revisit some old memories from when I was a kid, the area isn't far from me. 

I'm good looking, funny, confident, great hair, great voice, i have women, i have money, but I'm not happy. My entire personality feels empty, I just emulate whatever character I've seen before, for whatever suits the situation. I don't really feel like a person. When i'm not trying to emulate anyone, all I really am is just angry, edgy, unfunny, blunt, and above all just stubborn. My refusal to change as I grew up is ultimately why I am suffering, my suffering has always been my own fault.

I realised that my attitudes towards women and my outlook on life stems from my deep hatred of my mother, growing up and even now I wanted nothing more for her to die and suffer. I wish I had talked about this to someone earlier. Maybe I would have been able to become someone more functional. I suppose the feeling of betrayal from the person I loved most will never leave me, it will always hurt, and I just can't seem to forget. 

My wrists really hurt, i'm in no danger of dying anymore, I'm just dizzy and want water. Maybe I don't even want to die, if i truly dead I wouldn't be alive right now. Or perhaps its the natural instinct to survive that's restricting me?",suicide

"I have multiple mental illnesses and after an unlucky layoff, have been unemployed for 1.5 years so I will be choosing between suicide and ??? very soon. Open to unusual suggestions.**Just read the bold text as a TL/DR if you want.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**: I graduated with a useless liberal arts degree - German - that I deeply regret in December 2014. The winter graduation date was a result of taking a semester off due to incapacitating mental health issues. I have a little OCD, some Borderline Personality Disorder traits, and am formally diagnosed as Bipolar Type II. I take a high dose of Lamictal but due to the nature of my diagnosis I am somewhat medication resistant and therapy has never helped much either. I fight intrusive thoughts and extreme depression on a daily basis. **I have spent 3 out of the 4 years since I graduated unemployed.** It took me a year to find a job. I was laid off from that job after only a year there because the company was doing poorly. That happened just eight months after I had left my parents' house. I didn't even make it a year on my own. That was a year and a half ago. I cannot find a fucking job. I have tried everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

*The reality is that someone with almost no experience and no connections and can only rely on the internet to find work is dealing with so much competition that it is almost impossible to find a job without a STEM degree. Over the past month, for example, I have applied to 185 jobs and only made it to a 2nd round in-person interview 4 times. So here we are...* 

&amp;#x200B;

**I'm ready to die. I have a note and a plan.** 

&amp;#x200B;

\- I have just one friend IRL who I rarely see or hear from. On my steam friends list there is one person who I game with sometimes, he is a great friend who I have known for a couple years but we have never met. My relationship with my parents is nonexistent even though I live with them. We have never been close and they have done some fucked up things in the past. **There is very little guilt associated with the thought of leaving the 4 people who are part of my life behind.** I have read enough of r/SuicideBereavement to know what it'd do to them and I don't care most of the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- **My suicide method of choice is irreversible. Guaranteed to kill me.** This will not be one of those impulsive acts where someone didn't take enough pills or jumped off of a building that wasn't high enough. I will be gone. Thus, I must be very certain about having no other options left. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Your life might be very different from mine and therefore you'll say ""why not just find a retail or food service job and accept living with your parents?"" *That is not something I can accept*. I didn't push through my terrible mental health issues to graduate with honors to live a life like this.** This house is full of traumatic memories and as depressed as I am now, there is no way I could work at Macy's or Applebees and be stuck in this house indefinitely without getting even worse and killing myself**. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- **I refuse to be hospitalized and will not do outpatient either.** I was too honest with my psychiatrist a couple weeks ago and almost got myself involuntarily committed. I have a very bad attitude about therapy and meds. Trapping me in a fucking looney bin with nothing but a smock would inevitably lead to me assaulting someone and having even more problems. I refuse to be doped up on meds to the point where I think this situation is fucking fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

**At this point, I don't know what the fuck I can do. Here are the things that occur to me at this point, in order from most reasonable to least:** 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Sign up for a temp agency and hope to find a ""temp to permanent"" role that actually pans out. The problem with those jobs is that they do not pay enough to get me out of this fucking house, even if it is full time. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Accept that my life has fallen apart and that I need to start over and go back to school for a degree that is actually useful. That plan would prevent waiting tables or something awful like that from bringing me to suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Get a Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) certification and leave this country for somewhere with a low cost of living. It is going down in flames and I have almost nothing keeping me here anyway. I have a car that is worth around $10,000 that I could sell to get out of here and pay for the certification. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Accept my suicide as inevitable - living with all of these conditions is fucking terrible - and do something radical like selling the aforementioned car and blowing my money on some kind of cross country trip or even a one way ticket to somewhere else. $10k gets you a long way in a third world country. You may laugh at this but I'm actually kind serious about this one. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Kill myself. Send my note to everyone as a text before doing it. That's it. This miserable existence I never asked for would be over. I have had sex, fallen in love, been to Europe, enjoyed meaningful friendships, done psychedelics. Its been nice. But I can't take this shit anymore at the same time. Every day is the same. Sitting at this fucking desk. Miserable. Insane. Lonely. Hopeless. I think about suicide constantly.

"Never thought I'd be having suicidal thoughts.I don't really care that this is my main account.

I'm currently camping with my four best friends in the world. We planned this trip for ages and now it's actually happening, but once again my mental illness ruins things for everyone. Last night I freaked out because they wanted to go for a walk in the woods at midnight without phone signal and I was terrified they might die. One of my friends gave me a much deserved talking to and said that the world shouldn't revolve around me, which is of course right. I shouldn't be controlling them, it's just the anxiety talking.

I stayed up with my absolute best friend and another friend until three, when we decided to go to bed. However, despite knowing I was in a fragile mental state my best friend decides to go off and leave me upset. I messaged them asking just to chat because I was lonely, to be told that I was making a big deal out of nothing and I should forget about it. You can't just forget anxiety issues, they're always there.

I cried myself to sleep, then woke early this morning shaking. Some mean part of me wanted to make them worry about me as much as I worry about them, so I took my blanket and went for a long walk in the woods to see if I could spot some wild boar. I got back after about an hour but noone had contacted me asking where I was even though I knew they were awake, so I went and sat by the cafe and browsed reddit until one friend found me. She said she'd been looking everywhere for me and that my best friend was worried sick. I was finally happy - he actually cared.

When we got back to the tent, he was asleep. I don't know about you but when I'm worried sick about someone I don't fall asleep until they're found. I left again. I'm now sat by the cafe again crying my eyes out. I'm always there for them, but I never feel like they care for me at all. I'm entertaining suicidal thoughts for the first time in my life - maybe if I killed or seriously injured myself they'd finally care about me? I'm tempted to make myself throw up right now so they might actually take me seriously. I'm a disgrace, and everyone's fed up with me. At least if I killed myself they'd actually care.",suicide

"Is this actually DBT, or is this just bad therapy for depression?My therapist's response to ""I wish I could die without affecting anyone else,"" was ""Well that's impossible. Of course people who love you would miss you. I would miss you. It would be devastating!""   That seems little short of guilt tripping.  I won't say it's totally ineffective, but I kind of expected more from a DBT intensive therapist.  Or does DBT assume that the greatest motivation is positive attention? Because it totally leverages the therapuetic relationship like it means more to me than anything else in the world.  Like, Sorry, you're ok and all, but you're just my therapist. I don't even know you.  Self harm has been officially unamed ""unacceptable,"" and is punnishable by 24 hours of no contact/no phone coaching.  Phone coaching, the thing they're supposed to try to get you to use instead of trying (again) to kill yourself... If somebody's so desperate they're self-harming, possibly with intent to kill.  You can totally fix it by leveraging the need for continued attention against the need to feel better at any cost.  For the love of god, why is there the assumption someone really just wants attention more than anything, and if they get it for being ""good"" (presenting as asymptomatic) and not for being ""bad"" (symptomatic), they'll stop self harming or attempting suicide (being symptomatic)?   You cannot just *manipulate* me out of being suicidal.  That's not how this works.  I came to DBT for a robust empirically proven form of therapy that is supposedly... heavy-duty, or industrial strength or whatever.  Supposedly perfect for severely depressed chronically suicidal people.  That's what I came for, but I'm not sure what it is that I'm getting.  It assumes people are illogical attention-motivated children above all else.   While I'm not some mastermind genius, I find that pretty insulting.  What, do I get a gold star for each day without self-harm, too?  I know! Let's go full out in behaviorism and do a token economy.  /s  I'm studying psychology and neuroscience, and this shit does not jive with what I've been taught to expect of DBT.  I'm disappointed, really.  Flat out salty.  That and it's full of jargon that I can hardly begin to parse out.  My therapist says I need to work on my Committment to Living like it's a proper noun or something. Oh and Mindfulness as a cure to everything including all misery of existence.  I don't like mindfulness, I actually kind of hate it, and the deep breathing bullshit too.  It doesn't work.   I don't like this toolkit, I don't like this therapy, and I hate this life. --Treatment resistant depressive. Nothing works. Not even a little.",suicide

"Let me explain to you why suicide is the best thing ever for ANYBODYSuicide is awesome. Because suicide by definition is the intentional taking of own's life. You take your own life. Your actions do it. Nature doesn't kill you, you don't die just randomly, no you fucking do it. Isn't that awesome? I think it is...because death is fucking great, and your own actions cause it. I love death. And today death is going to become reality for me. I'm really depressed and i have anxiety, but i haven't told anyone. Because i just don't see the point in it really. What good would that do me? I get help...and i kill myself some other time. Because that's just the way my brain is. So fuck it Reddit. Let's go out with a bang shall we. I had this eternal struggle for a very long time and i made up my mind. And i'm happy because it's going to be over soon Reddit. But Reddit i need to ask you something first. Do you want to watch it? My suicide. Because if you do, then yeah i can livestream it. I don't care. I know some people find it fucked up and not cool, but a lot of people want to see it right? So i'm down Reddit...i'm down

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to kill myself in a isolated place so i don't know when people will find my body, if ever even. That's the way i prefer. I don't want to hurt people that are close to me. Okay that sounded wrong, i know i'm going to hurt them if i disappear but it's not going to much of a mind fuck like a suicide would be. At least that's what i think. Anyway Reddit if you want to see it, tell me and i'll make a post before i go live okay?",suicide
"I want to die honorableI don't know if this is suicidal but I want to die in a way that I myself find glorious. While I know I would never harm myself willingly, I yet desire to cease existing.   
But as the good nature in me calls for doing something good and helping others I want to die in a battle. I would like to join some militia or organization that fights terror groups or generally saves other people so I could at least do something good for other people one last time before I leave.  
And in case I don't die from that then great. But I doubt it because I am not good. I have never been to the military because my health problems are too much of a burden. And where I live almost every male goes to the military at adult age. So I also feel like I am missing out on something important even though I don't regret having to go there. But yet perhaps that would make it up for this. I mean someone without experience like me will die fast anyway, right? So doing something good and something I feel proud of while leaving with honorable actions is just the perfect setup.   
Because else I am just a burden and non-loved by anyone. I cannot love myself because I can only do that if others love me as well. I am the kind of person that depends on others. I have to push myself and if I can't go on I just feel horrible.  
For years I have tried following my dreams, actually doing my best to achieve things in life but all failed. Sure I tried and did my best, there is nothing more I can do. But this is exactly what bothers me. If my best isn't enough to continue, what else can I do? You don't wanna see me try my worst if my best is already that horrible...  
And I had enough always having to fight for things I never get in the end while others get it laid out on their hands. Be it job and career or love life.   
Sure I have friends and family, I have a roof over my head and food on the plate.   
But life is more than just surviving, especially in these times where society expects much more of someone.  
I often say I just wanna die but when I say I wanna die I really just mean I wanna finally start living and not just surviving like right now. But the more days pass, the more I think perhaps it actually is for the better if I do die.  
Today it pushed me on the edge, I had to hold a blade to my throat and chest for the first time in many many years. To think I really be pushed that hard...  
But I don't know why for some reason I still do have hope. I kinda always have hope for something. I cannot explain this phenomenon. Even if I think I plan to die in battle, I yet have hope to leave it alive and gaining new experience and mindset that could change me positively. Even in such negativity, I find positivity. But this all is a double-edged sword. the one side that has hope that something good could happen but the other side that is right now a bit sharper than the other, the side that just wants me to die.  
Does anyone else feel like this? Can you understand this?

"Here's what's going on in Texas for those who don't know There was a big snowstorm a couple days ago. Gas is something you have to pay for there, which they voted on (red state). republicans dont think gas should be provided by the government and because they voted against it, it isn't. It was a really bad snowstorm as a result of climate change (one of the worst in texas history, and they don't get much snow there).

So, some people can't afford the gas and the concern is they'll freeze to death in their own homes because they don't have gas. Gas isn't just heat either, their water isn't being treated by the state right now and stoves aren't working to cook. 

At least 25 people have died as of 24 hours ago. To give you an idea of it 3 kids died when they accidentally lit their house on fire trying to stay warm and a man was found frozen to death in his recliner.

"I feel ugly, and it makes me feel like I have less value as a person.I deal with body dysmorphia. Not that the things I see don't exist, but I realize that I obsess over my appearance more than most people do.

I find myself hideous. My face slants. It's fucked up that I couldn't just have a normal face. Doesn't have to be gorgeous. But I mean, my whole fucking face slants to the side. Logically, I know that people probably don't care. But I constantly think about when I am talking to people. I see it. I obsess over plastic surgery. I obsess over ways to make it less noticeable. It's going to cost around $20-30,000 if I want to fix it. Part of the problem is I have a cross under bite. So it makes my jaw slant to the left. But then I have a droopy eye. Which looks more apparent because of the slanted jaw. If I want to get the eye fixed that's around $3-5000. Even my fucking ears are slanted. My face looks like I had bell's palsy, but without the complete loss of muscle movement in the side of my face. 

These things aren't in my head. I wish I had full on body dysmorphia where I just see things that aren't real. I've posted on /r/rateme and people have pointed out exactly the things I see. When I was a kid and got my ears pierced at the mall, they said they normally would pierce one ear a little higher and the other a little lower to make them look symmetrical. However, my ears are so crooked that they couldn't even do that. You can't even surgically fix crooked ears.  Today I went and got botox, and the lady recommended that I get microblading for my eyebrows because it would make my eye look less droopy. Which of course I'm going to do (but not with her), because if I can make myself look less crooked for a couple hundred bucks then yes I'm going to do it. Beats the several thousand. 


My family thinks I'm vain. Which I guess I am. But you know, that's pretty freaking easy for them to say. Somehow I was the only one born with a half smashed face. I'm the ugly duckling. But I'm superficial because I want to get work done to make myself look normal. 

I understand that I'm being shallow. Of course people still will talk to me even if I'm ugly. I'm great at making friends. But you know what I'm not good at? Getting guys I love to stay. They move on to much prettier girls. I'm the girl they date while they have low self-esteem. I have a nice body. I'm the girl they want to hit and quit. You bang the body, but you marry for the face. 

I just don't think I'll be at peace in my head until I get the surgeries done. But I can't afford them. Sure, you'll probably tell me that it won't make me happy. I call bull shit. When I was younger, I had an eating disorder. I hated my body. I hated my thighs and wanted that coveted thigh gap. Now, years later, I work out, and like I said, I have a good body with curves. But I also now have that coveted thigh gap. And you know what? I fucking love it. It makes me feel good that I can stand with my feet together and my thighs don't touch. Dumb that I put so much value on it? Yeah, probably. But it rings true that if I fixed my other physical flaws that it would make me feel better too.",suicide

"My mom cant take it anymore. Neither can I.Ive been depressed and anxious for most of my life. My parents havent helped. They listened in the first little while when things got really bad but now Im just annoying to them. Ive been going through a prolonged period of being suicidal (Im talking fucking years dude) and Im experiencing a serious spike right now. Everything is something I could kill myself with. Electrical cord is a noose. Could drop a hair dryer into my bathtub. Slit my wrists with the xacto set I bought to try and feel better and make something instead of doing nothing. I cant hold down a job, Im living at home, isolated. I have a boyfriend but he just isnt helping. The feeling, the itch to kill my self is too strong. I keep trying to get him to leave the house so I can just do it. Im terrified of death but between the depression and chronic physical pain due to it and the isolation, I cant feel anything. Im either numb or crying and this has been going on for weeks. Im back to forgetting what even a fleeting moment of happiness is. And to top it off, the only thing Ive been looking forward to for months, the only thing Ive been trying to live for I cant go to anymore. Im a failure and I have nothing and not even my dog likes me. Im better off dead. 

A few days ago I was just lying on the floor in the garage. Id been trying to build something to keep busy but the materials my dad said we had werent right and I just spiralled. I laid on the concrete floor and when my mom came in the first thing she said was that she couldnt take it anymore. It being me being suicidal and depressed. She wanted to send me to a hospital (despite the last time me going, I got misdiagnosed and put on Effexor which made my life an unlivable hell) instead of just being a parent when all I said literally a day prior was I was cripplingly lonely. They willingly put themselves out of the house on the weekends so Im just alone. They wont even take a single day to spend with me. The every next day they left me alone again.

If I'm dead why would it matter to me... but you KNOW there's a difference in how people view the... resulting dead from the tragic accident of being hit by a car crossing the street vs the horror of being murdered vs the struggle of a terminal illness vs the... shame? of killing yourself like damn dont you wish you could control that one thing",suicide
"It came back.I am a M(12). I live in a very christian neighborhood.I have attempted suicide in 2017, but have obviously failed. After that I started seeking out help keeping it a secret from everyone including my parents. I recovered by the mid-end of spring 2018, and have accidentally told some people that I have attempted suicide, but luckily they think it was a joke.

The reason for the depression (I have never actually been diagnosed but had all of the symptoms) is abuse I have been yelled at and beaten since kindergarten (about 5 years old) and have been humiliated and bullied for my looks (overweight) since the start of primary school. And increasing pressure to fulfill my high expectations (straight As). And during all of this being told that the abuse was ""normal"".

Ever since my recovery I have been making efforts to get slimmer which were mostly stopped by my parents saying that I cant go on a diet because I was so young (instead of a diet I just started eating healthier), my dad stopped beating me because he knew I was getting stronger (working out) and would fight back. But the emotional manipulation and verbal abuse did not stop. 

On the start of august I was staying at my Aunts and Uncles house for a week. And that week was great, because I had no expectations, I kept working out, I kept a stable weight, I had a cat who made it way less lonely being inside most of the time. But then I came back home. And on the SECOND DAY of me being back my dad just came out of nowhere and tried to kiss me, but my arm got in the way. Immediately he started yelling at me saying that I have no respect for him, that I do not know what love, and that I do not love him, and how ungrateful I am for all he has done for me. He also yelled that    he will take away all my rights including free speech. And whenever I tried to say anything he would cut me off and yell ""DO NOT ANSWER ME!"". He said that he hated how I was relaxed when he started yelling at me.

This is after another similar case that happened a few weeks ago when we went on a walk and he started yelling at me because food is not all I want from him. As I said this is similar to the case described above. Except that in this one I had a mental breakdown, he punched me, and gave me a promise that we will never get angry at each other ever again (I knew this was bullshit) except if I ""screw up"".

And the day after he yelled at me, made me cry enough to fill 100 of those ""male tears"" mugs, and broke a promise. The next day he acted as if nothing happened. One thing he got right that night is that I do not love him, I realized I do not love him 2 years ago. If it was not for the laws of this country I would have murdered him, but I could not even defend myself because of how emotionally overwhelmed I was, I could not say anything I just imagined killing him.

And ever since that day the suicidal thoughts came back, slowly but they did. And now I do not have emotional support I don't know who to tell this, except you.",suicide

"It's been One YearI kind of have a weird tradition I've been technically doing for nearly a decade now, though it's also sort of off and on. See, every year after my most recent suicide attempt, I celebrate it's anniversary. Whether it's a treat to myself or, as was with this past Wednesday, spending the day with myself, I look back on the day I last attempted. I refect on the year and whether or not I think it's been worth surviving.

However, this past ""anniversary"" was the first one I could actually celebrate in about four years. Since my first one, I've attempted seven times, and four of those have been stopping said celebration for just under half a decade. You'd think I'd have gotten better since it's finally been a year, right?

There's not that urge to go and jump off something or to slice myself open, but rather a void that's growing inside. Not necessarily something that is sucking me dry, but rather attempting to fill me up with the emptiness. I'm constantly trying to fight this, but I'm thrown a curve ball each time.

There's nothing I can do, is there? There's no point in celebrating if I keep losing. I'm just hurting so much, and I know I'm too broken to be fixed. If I can't even appreciate the year since my last attempt, what's the point?",suicide

"fuck it, im over this shitI Thought losing weight would make things better. I just need abs and Ill be happy. I still look in the mirror and see the fat kid who shoved bags of Doritos into his mouth daily. I Thought going to college and having fresh faces and a fresh start would stop the feelings deep down. It didnt. Thought finding a girl to be happy with would make me happy. It didnt. Thought starving myself to finally make my body how I always wanted it to look would help make me feel better in the long run. It didnt. Everyday I wake up wishing I hadnt. I still get out of bed and try every day though. Some days are better than others. Today was amazing. Spent the entire day with a beautiful girl. Her laugh and smile made me laugh and smile. Yet here I am at 1am with suicidal thoughts. I fight a losing  battle every fucking day man. Things arent getting any easier. Ive realized I have no passions. No hobbies. No real drive for anything in life. I feel so lost everyday. I dont know how much longer I can hold out honestly. The only reason I havent jumped off a building yet is because it would ruin my family. I love my little sisters and I know how much it would impact their lives to attend the funeral of their big brother. Guys your big brother is trying, I really am. I just want to be happy but every day is somehow worse than the last. Im sick of picking myself up just to be knocked down again. Fuck this cycle.

That wont happen if I kill myself. But Im also scared of going to hell.

"Please helpI'm 19, I'm in college, my parents are still together. I have a roof over my head, food on the table and a boyfriend that cares greatly for me. So what could possibly be wrong with me? Why do I hate everything so much? 

I'm so afraid that I'm not good enough for my boyfriend. I'm not good enough for my parents or my family. I have virtually no friends. Nobody cares about me except for my boyfriend but I know I'm wearing him down.

I was raped when I was 16 by a random man. He pushed me against the wall and pinned me by wrapping his hands around my neck. He pulled off my pants and began to feel around before he pulled down his own pants and raping me. I've never told anyone this until now, but his memory haunts me every night.

When I was younger my father used to grope me and when I reached puberty he began to touch me even more inappropriately. To this day, I can't look at my father the same way.

My boyfriend and I just recently started having sex. He's my first, besides that man. He doesn't know about this, but sometimes when we're intimate...I just get flash backs of that night when I was raped, and sometimes of my father.

I live every day scared, scared of running into that man once more. Scared of losing the only person that cares about me. Scared of my father touching me. 

My parents abuse me. They choke me until I pass out, and throw things at me. Things that would break bones or skin if I didn't dodge out of the way. They hit me almost every day just because they can.

Piling up I have severe depression and aspergers. I am 23. I'm gay. I cannot relate to people outside of a very small group of people and part of how I learned to relate to others is through drugs. I am on and off but don't really associate with my old friends who still use heavily pretty often. When I do I feel welcome though and not judged so long as I'm getting high with them. I don't have the social skills or life skills to make my life any better because I am a terrific failure. I've learned to surround myself with people who wouldn't judge or criticize me even for my own good. I stopped talking to a lot of my family but they didn't want anything to do with myself or my dad and siblings anyway. I've wanted to die for more than 13 years. I'm really really tired. The only thing that would drive me when I was younger was thinking eventually I could support myself making artwork and music or just creating. As much as it's the only emotional outlet I have left I realize how pointless it is without already being wealthy. I work retail. I will never afford an education. Taking loans is suicide anyway.  I hate myself and I'm fully aware of the deep resentment most people feel for the fact that myself and people like me exist. I am going to kill myself eventually because I can't possibly live in the us being who I am. Escapism was really the last thing I had left. Pretending that there was a place and people who gave a shit about me and escaping into that fantasy. I won't ever stop hurting and I don't have a life outside of feeling that pain anymore. ,suicide

"I was told to post hereHello,

So I made [This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/DoesAnybodyElse/comments/jwwh9/dae_have_suicidal_thoughts_on_a_daily_basis/) last night somebody told me to make a post here. 

So basically I've been having suicidal thoughts for a few years now - thoughts like how I'd kill myself, who would be effected, what if anything would happen to me afterwards. Never really crossed into serious planning, but at one point I put aside a bottle of Oxycotin and Vodka and hid it in my bookcase. It's made me feel really good to just have it sit there, but I have no plans to use it.

I don't think I'm depressed - I'll have my waves of bad thoughts but I'd say a good 80% of my day is me having genuine fun and being happy. 

I just don't really know where to go from here. I thought the suicidal thoughts I was having were as normal as people's murder/rape thoughts. Happens a few times a day but never anything serious, so no harm no foul, right? But reading some comments last night and this morning have led me to believe that suicidal thoughts are not normal, but I'm pretty confident mine are just thoughts and will never lead to actions.

Should I just go on with my life like normal?",suicide

"Extreme anxiety over potential crime, advice neededI (19M) have been struggling tremendously with OCD, especially recently, and my recent intrusive thoughts are causing me tremendous anxiety and rumination.

Relatively recently (think a few weeks/months ago), I messaged multiple girls from nsfw subreddits such as gonewild.  Nearly every single time, there was no reply.  However, my mind just thought of something which is giving me tremendous anxiety.  What if the people I messaged were underaged, even though I didnt know about it?  I always subconsciously assumed, due to those subreddits having an 18+ limit, that I would only be messaging adults, however my mind is going insane thinking that they may have been underaged.  I never thought that I was messaging anybody underaged, and if I ever had reasonable suspicion that a person was, I would never have even thought about messaging them.

I dont know how valid it is, but Im just thinking that what I did is a horrible crime and that Im going to get sentenced to prison for multiple years for what I did.  Im incredibly anxious that Im in some kind of legal trouble due to what I did.  This is my sole cause of the anxiety.  If there is any lawyer or person with extensive legal knowledge, could they please comment and let me know if I am going to go to prison for this.

I swear, I never knowingly messaged an underaged person.  To this day, every person I have messaged, I do not have a single reason to believe was underaged.

"Ideation ended up in making a noose tonight.Or trying too. Or experimenting with putting the belt around the shower rail. Even though I had no real intention of killing myself, I did put my head in and let it choke me a bit and possibly hoped Id slip and accidentally end up hanging myself.

I feel like Im too sensitive for this world. And that sensitivity is seen as a negativity by most, I care about people too much, I get attached and when Im scared to lose them I end up pushing them away because Im too intense in wanting to let them know how valued they are to me. Most recently a friend from work, who i admitted having feelings for when drunk on a night out, who was a good friend. A month ago she was telling me how thoughtful I was due to the gifts Id got her. Now, she wants nothing to do with me and I know its basically because I sent a way too intense text about still wanting to retain the friendship.

This has been a pattern for me - I develop these great friendships and then get close and ruin it - with my best friend after we had kissed and now with this colleague. I try and rein it in but I just cant help it. With this lady, I genuinely felt we flirted and feel stupid for misreading the signs, she had been getting touchy feely a bit towards the end, patting my butt and joking I was her work-husband (she is single).

When this happens I feel it erases all the positive things they thought about me, because one mistake and I end up losing all that, so it doesnt matter how funny they found me, how thoughtful she thought I was, in the end I just ruin it.

I dont feel I have anything to offer because the positive traits werent enough and I feel like Im just not good enough and there must be something fundamentally wrong with me. My ex told me she loved me, spent one week on holiday with me after she cried 2 hours after getting there due to homesickness, and after 2 weeks of looking after her dumped me when we got back. From soulmate to dumping me after 10 days together where I pretty much just looked after her and cancelled my trip early to get her back home (I had planned it for a year and spent a lot of money).

I feel like Im too sensitive for a man, and that Im not attractive due to it and have nothing to offer and could never be in a long relationship or close friendship due to how sensitive I am. And that I just at care too much about people and get hurt when they leave.

And I really am just tired of it now. Im 31 but I feel like Ive been struggling for so long.",suicide

I've made my decision, I've made my final preparations and now its simply a matter of finding the courage to cut. I've stared at this blade everyday for the past two weeks, and now the fear is gone. Time, time comes to a standstill when the blade is against my skin, I know that if I cut it just right, I'll fall asleep and never wake in the world of the living again.

"I am Inadequate...I am not in desperate need of attention, I do not have a rope around my neck, and I am not looking for sympathy. So just a fair warning, If you do not want to waste time listening to my useless rambling, there are others in more dire need than I.

To begin.. There have been multiple cases throughout my life where I have thought to myself that suicide is the only option, never actually done it before. Most of this is due to my depression that I have experienced throughout my entire life, built on with stress, worries, ect, ect... Recently A lot of extra shit has caused me to start sinking deeper and deeper into my weak sorrow. 

I have my first ever finals coming up tomorrow. I am a freshman, and since 4th grade I have had nothing aside from As with a B on the side every now and then. This year though, I am struggling to maintain a B-C average. I have been sick and unable to study or focus on my finals for around a week or more, and I am almost sick to think about taking my finals knowing that  I will probably flunk them, bringing even more dissapointment onto my mother, more than usual.

I don't want to go to in dept about my pity as you all have more important things to do than listen to a 15 year old Freshman whine and complain about his life.. I am looking for anyone to talk to, just to help me out, and through all of whatever I am going through. And if you made it this far reading this, I applaud and thank you.",suicide

At what point is suicide acceptable? How many more days/months/years do I have to wait?28 year old female over here woo fucking hoo. Been depressed suicidal on and off since I can remember. Couple of failed attempts in my teens. It's been 8 months since my depression hit hard again. I keep setting a date then moving it. At this point if I try I'm not going to fail. Gotta buy a gun still. Been doing my research on how best to succeed. Just trying to plot the end. At what age is it finally going to be reasonable to throw in the towel? Do I really need to wait it out for years until it becomes so blaringly obvious that this life isn't worth the trouble. Seems like I've already figured that out but I keep holding on just in case. Not many more years left before spinsterdom sets in. Maybe 30? If I can make it that long. I don't know something's gotta give. I'm no spring chicken. I don't want to grow old and alone. At a certain point my life goals will be out of reach and I'll be left with nothing. At that time suicide is fair. It's just. It's reasonable. At this time I'm just waiting for my father to die so I don't have anyone to hurt. Maybe I answered my own question when he goes I will too. I just feel like if I set a reasonable date and stick to it all this pressure will be lifted. I'll have a goal. Just make it through until that date. I can do that. it's the unending road thats daunting. If there's a date I can compartmentalize. I can rest easy knowing the end is in sight. But when???,suicide
"I see it quite clearly now. Suicide IS the best option for me.I've been meditating a lot recently and I've come to the conclusion that there simply is no reason for me to be here. I don't like or care for anything in the world. I don't understand why someone with a mental illness would want to get better. There is nothing on the other end. I guess there is for some people, but not for me. Not because no one cares for me, some do, but because I don't care for anyone or anything. I don't care that my family will miss me and wonder what they did wrong. They did nothing wrong except for creating me. None of this would've happened had I not existed, and that's their burden to bear. I have hobbies to pass the time. When I don't think much about it I like them. When I actually think deeply about it I realise how pointless they are.

I guess I would like to be convinced otherwise, but none of your false optimism is going to sway me. Things could get better, sure, but if I was dead I would never know, so what's the point in risking even more suffering for myself? As I said, the suffering of others is of no concern to me.

whats the alternative seriously i have chosen not to die so many times when i wanted to and it leads nowhere i am already in therapy i already take medication i was already hospitalized 3 times in the past year nothing makes any difference i was kicked out of my schools counseling for using it too long my new doctor blew me off for three weeks and now no one is willing to see me to refill my meds two of which are now completely gone but hey fuck it i wont need them when i am dead right ,suicide
every time i come off my meds and it makes me remember whati amlike without them i just lose so much hope i know coming off my meds is dangerous ive done it once before and had to be hospitalized i recently got pretty sick and wasnt able to stomach my meds soi ammostly off of them at the moment and i amjust miserable i know that its just a phase thatll pass wheni amback on but it gets so exhausting and frustrating to remember that at my core this is who i ami am not able to naturally be happy my brain doesnt work right and i always think that in survival of the fittest i never should have made it i think its amazing i have but i am so young 22 and i just hate the cyclical pattern of being okay for a while and then it all just collapsing again and againi amjust tired of it alli am not surei amactually suicidal right nowi amjust tired and hopeless i know i will be okay when i get back on my meds but at the same time i feel like i shouldnt have to take meds just to be able to feel normal like most people are its not fair and i know the world isnt fair but its just a lot i dont want to go through my whole life like this but i dont know that i have any other option ,suicide
so sick of being told not to kill myself no one will help help doesnt exist at least not for me if no one will helpi amsick of feeling like i have to reassure peoplei am not less than two weeks from ending it alli amsick of googling and being told to call the hotlinei amsick of being told to go to therapy i want to feel like someone gets it before i go i want the horrible truth not the patronizing liesedit honestly whati amsaddest about is not seeing the end of game of thrones or hearing the next panic at the disco album it isnt enough to continue but felt like sharing,suicide
only 15 and boy am i done with life i just cant take this anxiety i feel everyday school is tough teachers are unfair to me my grades are under average and the few friends i have bully me everyday by calling me mean things its not the words that hurt me cause i know that they actually dont mean it its the fact that they want hurt me that does all i feel is empty,suicide
i dream happy dreams about my death and wonder about how my mind works ive never been diagnosed with anything other than some panic attack issues years ago caused by some heavy insomnia that placed me in hospital after my heart went crazy after 6 days awake thats mostly better now though i sleep almost every night but i am just curious are these the kind of mindsets and emotions usually felt by those in depression ive spoken to people i know who have suffered or do suffer from depression and it doesnt seem to fit how they describe itsometimes i get waves of despair and hopelessness when this happens i literally cant even imagine a future not even tomorrow it scares me as my imagination is just taken away and i am trapped in the horrible moment unable to picture anything being better i mean this literally too as in my mind is totally unable to picture anything in the future at all other times i go numb theres no emotion ,suicide
i am ugly i am ugly and that makes me sad but at least i am tall can i just end this,suicide
goodbye world this is it i cant deal any longer with my pain i am tired i was blessed with nothing in my life i am lost and stopped eating i am finally at peace with my decision i know no one cares and thats ok it just makes it that much easier,suicide
theres no reason to suffer if consciousness survives after death its reasonable to assume it doesnt age or die and is endless if it doesnt then life is restricted to the few years we spend on this planet either way there is no point in continuing a human existence mine sucks so why shouldnt i end it,suicide
i dont really know where to start ever since i was 13 i ve wanted to kill myself i remember the first time i seriously contemplated taking my own life i just dont know why i hate my life so much because again so many people have been through so much more i am so grateful that i have these opportunities and i wish i could give it all to someone who has nothing because i am not worthy of what i have thanks for listenings,suicide
life got fucked up by family so i was unlucky enough to be born with parents that were jehovah witnesses i cannot understand how parents just assume that their kid will follow their religion and force them to live their life by gods word i m thinking about ending it all soon although it s not like anybody would miss me as i have no friends because those are banned too unless it s someone from our church,suicide
i want to die alone what i honestly want is to be diagnosed with terminal cancer but not tell anyone i want to just walk into the mountains and shoot myself somewhere secluded no horrific body to clean up if the animals take care of it right nobody will really notice i will just pass out of memory as it should be ,suicide
not sure what to do its getting harder and harder to get out of bed i am only happy when i m with someone anyone i guess i just wanted to see this all written out my willpower to resist the urge to end it all gets weaker as time goes on thanks for reading,suicide
probably going to delete this basically i have had thoughts relating to suicide for several months to a year now i went from being legitimately suicidal to being a teen with occasional suicidal thoughts i am not currently in danger but i wanted some help i frequently think of what would happen if i killed myself i think of the personal experience the pain the person that finds me the people that may or not care about me how it would affect family and friends does it make me go to hell etc is this something to be concerned about again this may be deleted to cover up my emotions,suicide
sitting alone crying a forest with a bunch of pills in my hand i am so close denial rejection and my bad life situation plus extreme depressions and a broken offended heart would have started therapy in 4 days but then i realized in most cases it doesnt help and if then it takes years i have no zero motivation left and i just cant take it anymore no one to talk to alone since 7 years not even a damn hug ive gotten from anyone becausei amunable to talk to people and to go outside anyway i did my best to make it that long there is no more hope i am over the edge all bad emotions at once i m crying at least 1 hour every night i am so done no one can help me and the only person i ever loved rejected me i hate myself its too much,suicide
does anyone know the legal procedures following my suicide i am trying to set them up for the worst case scenario because it is likely to happen ,suicide
its literally all i ve been thinking about not a day goes by where i dont plan to kill myself i keep shaking and having panic attacks in public i cant take this anymore i tried to go to the hospital on friday in hopes that they could keep me safe from myself for a while maybe even treat me i dont know what to do anymore ,suicide
no matter what i do i still keep coming back here and keep feeling suicidal me too i guess thats why they say its a fight is the fight worth it i dont know i dont really believe it is,suicide
i might kill my self on saturday i hate myself and i feel so miserable and lonely sometimes i regret having happy moments because when the bad times come it just hits so hard i might take a lyft and jump off a bridge i am so selfish i want to care about myself instead of others just once and this will be the only timei am not sure if i will do it but my god right now i hope my future self could edit i just took 400mg of prozac idk what to expect but i feel woozy,suicide
feel horrible i am not sure why but for the past few days ive felt so horrible i want to die this isnt the first time i ve felt this way and it probably wont be the last i have a midterm tomorrow but i feel so bad i cant bring myself to study for it i need to pass all my classes this semester i cant afford to come back another semester i really just want to end it ,suicide
no one would probably care hi i am a 14 year old boy that lives in the us i really dont know if i am depressed or not but i just want to kill myself from day to day honestly at first it was fine i would get sad and want to kill myself and all but it will die down,suicide

i have a feeling that this year is going to be my last year i never had such feelings before i ve been depressed for more than three quarters of a decade and during this time it kept getting worse and worse recently i decided that i have had enough and i want to rest i m nothing but a failure and i drag everyone around me down i ve never been good at anything always disappointed everyone around me and i don t have real life friends haven t had any in many years i had a person i loves but she s gone and never coming back didn t work out i guess she never loved me to begin with but whateveryou get to a point where you just wonder if its all in your head or if its real i genuinely don t know if i am crazy or not fuck it i feel at peace and happy with my decision i shan t be missed or whatever c est la vie i ll be back on the day i do it to say good bye not like it matters i m a bitter asshole ,suicide
i cant take it anymore i am 25 and in grad school for a masters degree that i dont really want anymore my parents convinced me it would help me get a good job but i have no idea how much longer its going to take and my anxiety is only getting worse i have a history of self harm hitting myself that has relapsed since i began grad school and only he knows about it i am too afraid of pain and hurting those around me to actually commit suicide but i have had an overwhelming feeling on and off over the years that i wish i could get in a bad accident or have something bad happen to me i wish more than anything that i could drop out and just move on with life,suicide
today was the first time i thought about suicide and it was scary i ve always had this positive attitude about anything but now i am just tired tired of life and everything why not kill myself here and now solves my problems once and for all sorry if this isnt the place for this i am just scared of what will come next will this repeat itself when i am alone again will i eventually attempt suicide its the first time ive had this problem and it really scares me,suicide
i am a 16 year old from california i read somewhere that if you call the cops on yourself for being suicidal they ll take you to a hospital i dont know if that will cost any money though for the stay cause my family is having financial problems right now and i dont want to make us go so far into debt,suicide
i tried to jump off my balcony last night my husband caught me i m sad,suicide
work again or check in to the hospital as recommended i always ask for a permanent rest and no one can provide or afford that for me its not really of value for people to just rest all the time my soul is really broken and i am in more pain than is worthwhile so whats your plan for me after all the therapy and all the drugs at all the hospitalization its clear you have no plan other than to just send me back and hope i keep working put the onus on me to keep functioning and thats a plan failure,suicide
i ve tried everything else i just can not go on another day i ve decided that i can no longer deal with the hardship or struggle of life and have decided to end it today i see no other way out,suicide

my mind is telling me to kill myself please someone anyone be the voice of reason i am so scared,suicide
i realized my existence has no meaning the only thing i do is hurt people even by simply posting here none of this matters i am useless,suicide
i ve been teetertottering on the edge for the past few months which isnt saying much since i think about suicide a lot but lately i ve really wanted to go through with it i am just tired i am tired of being tired and life is sucking everything out of me and i cant stand it any longer i dont trust any government institutions like therapists ive taken so many different kinds of pills only to have them fuck me up worse than i already was or just not work at all i cant even talk to my therapist about the things that bother me because they never understand or i could go to prison if i did my health is shit it keeps getting worse and the shit doctors i keep going to tell me everything is fine i just need to lose weight even though i already have a eating disorder and lost 100 pounds and i am not even that fat and cant exercise very much due to my shitty health i am really thinking that maybe the best thing for me is to not exist anymore in order to end the damn near constant misery i feel i am already thinking about how to plan my death including figuring out where my cat will go funeral options exit plan etc i dont want to die tbh but dying seems a heck of a lot better than spending another 32 years hating my life and everything in it except my cat,suicide
how can i stop hating myself if all i do is keep hurting myself i ve been hating my self for 7 years and its been getting worse and worsei amthe biggest loser possible and i regret nearly everything i do ive moved house eight times over my life i can never keep a friend my social skills are terrible no matter how hard i try to improve them my eye contact is poor or too intense i dont understand body language and i have so little confidence that i stutter sometimes and merge my words together i avoid even looking at girls let alone talking to them because every time i do it makes me feel like shit ive tried antidepressants they make me feel absolutely nothing its horrible ive tried various self harm and i once stole from a boots pharmacy i was doing work experience for and overdosed alone worst night of my life ive been trying to be completely alone this past month so i stop doing stupid things i regret and trying to be more positive ive recently completely lost all my enthusiasm i havent told anyone this i feel that if i keep going on this route or if i start taking something then i will end up killing myself sorry if this heavy i just feel like i could do with someone to talk to you,suicide
somebody please stop me i was so close today i couldnt swallow the pills i was too weak pain doesnt end it will continue onto to others that care for you i heard this before and i believe that even though they dont say it many people care for you,suicide
even with therapy and medication i want to be dead so i dont have to suffer i am seeing a therapist i m on zoloft and xanax and i still want to die i have the means and access i think about it i think its going to be good for me that i dont have to feel this way anymore i cant logically think of a reason to stop myself because what people say youre supposed to do just doesnt seem like its working and if i tell my therapist or psychiatrist thati am in crisis i am going to have to go through all this again and i dont want to go through it anymore ,suicide
am i depressed or am i just looking for attention i definitely have anxiety and i think i have some kind of borderline disorder when i get this way all i do is lay down or talk about how i should kill myself i dont think id ever actually do it because my family loves me but ive noticed myself doing it just to make people notice is it all just made up in the back of my head to get peoples attention,suicide
dealing with too much right now feeling very depressed and anxious also nauseous and might have to vomit entire night again i dont think i ll ever be happy as much as my childhood days my head rewinds every bad thing happened in the past a lot if i had a painless and quick method i would be out already,suicide
why is there no limit don t call it the easy way out it s just it s not easy getting to that point it s not an easy decision to make it s not a deadline i have 0 issue setting i know what it will do to everyone i love and the people who love me even if there s not many that s not an easy thing to do to someone by any meansi see it as my to be selfish the i put myself first and i only see everyone trying to stop me againagain i m supposed to do what everyone else wants i m supposed to keep suffering to make everyone else feel like they are doing good i m supposed to fight because everyone else wants me to i m supposed to fight despite it being those same peoples fault to some degree that i m even here in the first placewhy is there no limit to how long you have to suffer just because it s in your head if i had cancer for the 50th time wanting to just end it all instead of treating it one more time everyone would be on my side,suicide
when suffering is too great i would like to start by saying that although brief i would need a million words to encompass the suffering i have endured in the past 3 years i am currently at a stage where i am thinking about committing suicide daily and frequently at that i have even tried desensitizing to various methods drowning etc by imagining them in depth the level of suffering has increased to a stage where i believe that i could overcome the thought of hurting people that i love because my suffering has greatly exceeded it as you are probably well aware the notion of a parent or grandparent enduring childs or family suicide is unbearable for them the grief it would cause my mother who has has an unbearable life of abusive husbands and skeletal disfigurement is great if i had access to a gun i would definitely would have killed myself the fear of drowning hanging or falling is greati want to die i want others to accept that i want to die i have been looking into possible euthanasia i am close to the endif you have read that all i thank you that is all i ask,suicide
i wish i was never born i ve never been good at anything and doubt i ever will be always living in the shadows of smart talented beautiful people who actually have a future sometimes i hate them most of the time i just hate myself out of everyone i knewi amthe biggest loser of them all everything is always about money and sex and its bullshit i am just some dirty poor how dare i have opinions hopes or aspirations i can never have independence and i feel like ive been set up to fail someone like me doesnt deserve to continue to take up resources better spent somewhere else i wish i could give my worthless life to someone who belongs i hope i find the courage to finally end my pathetic life,suicide

lost and hopeless at what point does it make sense to kill yourself because you have exhausted every other option i ve had suicidal thoughts for about a decade now but i never really considered actually doing it until quite recently i am so far down the drain that i dont think its humanly possible to obtain the life i want a somewhat normal life anymore i cant help but feel that this is my final hope i cant keep doing this crap anymore i am either going to get better soon or i am going to die there will not be an in between anymore,suicide

why should i get help if i dont want it i ve struggled with the idea of being alive and wanting to be alive for a while now i recently realized that i dont want help i just want to not be alive the only reason i would seek help is so that i dont hurt my loved ones ive attempted to kill myself before but i cant even begin to imagine what sort of pain and isolation that they would go through if i actually did it i dont want them to ever feel how ive felt but i just dont think that they understand how i feel even wheni am not feeling as depressed the thought of not being alive is so appealing ive always done only what others expect of me but ive never really wanted more for my life anyway ive tried therapy a few medications none of it has been right for me if they only knew how painful it is for me to be alive maybe they wouldnt be so insistent on me trying to get help i just cant wait for a medication or therapy to work that could take months or years every single day every hour every minute is so painful i just cant do it anymore,suicide

i feel lost and ultimately stucki am not at immediate risk of suicide i feel okay right now but lately ive caught myself fantasizing about peaceful ways of suicidei am not even going through anything traumatic or anything but its incredibly unlike me to be suicidal or even give it a thought and i think its rooted from me moving out for the first time and not looking back i feel like ive made a mistake even thoughi ammaking decent money and am able to sustain myself with it i dont even know if this is just me being stupid and not liking the transition to adulthood i honestly have no idea but some days i just go numb and my mind wanders into suicidal territory not out of sorrow but out of a genuine longing to escape whatever the feeling i was experiencing wasim currently about to clock into work so i will probably stop replying for a few hours but i just wanted to get all of this off of my chest i havent told a soul out of fear that someone will just resort to this guys just being an attentionwhorehes got nothing to feel bad about not to mention its kind of a big deal to say to a family member that ive recently had suicidal thoughts anyway i appreciate you guys for listening to me mumble and this might not even be the right sub asi am not fixing to do the deed if thats the case go ahead and remove it as i will be away from reddit for a bit thanks ,suicide
failed attempt 1 month ago going again ive lost all motivation to do anything school work any activities even video games which i was completely addicted to only a year ago now i mainly just lay in my bed wondering why i even exist for hours on end ive legitimately thought about suicide ever since i was 13 with time this thought got worst and now at the age of 17 ive lost count of how many times i tried to take my own life just a month ago i had an extremely scary attempt i hung a piece of rope from my door and suspended myself so if i stood on my tip toes i could barely breath then i let my legs relax and swung them in front of me i was completely blacked out within a few seconds but then about 3 minutes later i just woke up for no apparent reason the rope didnt break and there was still full suspension on my neck but i still fucking woke up and survived i didnt leave a note or anything i just really really wanted to fucking die that nightthat was scary enough to make me stop for a month waking up with a rope around your neck cold with saliva running down your face slowly realizing where you are and what happened but now the suicidal thoughts return and i want to try again perhaps i should tell someone about my problems but theyd just call someone and take me to a hospital being someone who actually wants to die constant supervision at a hospital is not idealschool mainly instigates these suicidal actions i once cried for a whole night over the score i got on a practice test and i believe i came very close to killing myself that night too anything can trigger it i must just have a really fucking muscular neck because i can not kill myself via hanging i have tried literally 100 times now but i am going to keep trying,suicide

i 23 f am struggling with suicidal thoughts again and though i dont believe that i would go through with it its difficult to wake up every morning for a bit of background a lot has happened to me recently and this isnt the first time ive felt suicidal ive been quite depressed for the past year and a half at one point around 6 months ago i started writing letters to friends and family in preparation though i suspect it was mostly cathartici am not sure i will also note that three years ago i had a drug overdose that i believe was a suicide attempt but i am not quite sure i was sort of in autopilot that day at the momenti amfinishing my degree moving out am seeing a psychiatric who believes i have bipolar disorder and struggling with general feelings of sensitivity and selfhatei amcrying almost every day i truly believe that the people around me are sick of me andor hate me but feel obliged to stick around the heightened sensitivity has been the hardest hurdle as a small incident can make me withdraw completely for days on end for instance around a week ago my friend and roommate had invited me to see other friends but i had a prior commitment he said he had decided to go later and i said i might come too then and he ignored the statement and planned around me i literally cried about this for days and thought that he must hate me and must not want to be around me becausei amprobably a buzzkill or hes tired of me and he probably doesnt care at all if he didnt even try to give an excuse or anything this is an example of the small occurrences that have been setting me off and forcing me to reflect on my own lack of selfesteemi dont want to be around myself either but i dont have a choicei amscared of finishing my degree because i think i might want to do masters but my parents will be so ashamedi amscared of staying with my aunt if i dont find a new place to live soon enough and my lease is up in two weeksi amscared of getting diagnosed with bipolari amscared of losing everyone in my lifei amjust so tired and i want to sleep all of the time i dont have the capability to get through the next month i wish i could pause time and find a hotel room so i could just sleep and cry alone for half a year i really dont know what to doi amstruggling to live minute to minute ,suicide

the right to die in this world we live in every one stands up for their rights when they can we have people who stand up for marriage equality the right to lead the lifestyle they choose whether it be gay if you ask is being gay normal people get upset and say yes of course it is i was born gay they would possibly say people are becoming more persistent with their rights their freedoms people insist that they are to be referred to in a certain way sir madam regard transgender communities and get upset when they are not blah blah blah black lives matter white lives matter fucking this group that group everyone stands up for a cause they strongly believe in what about the right to die why cant we see this as normal all my life i have wanted to die i have lost count of how many times i have tried with overdoses one of the last few times i tried was by hanging only for things to go black and for me to wake up gasping for airfailed again other times people would always find me unconscious from the overdoses when i was pretty sure there was no way for them to and the door was locked and last week i took a whole batch of valium and alprazolam in a bowl washed it down with waterand apparently i was the one who called 000 and an ambulance i can get completely smashed with alcohol and remember what i do but my wife when she came home after the ambulance took me to the fucking hospital says that i had been vomiting in the toilet and somehow i went for the phone and dialed for the ambulance what the fuck i can not remember this is it a cry for attention no just so they can put me in an acute ward and i loose all my jobs that i do for a week and things just get fucking worse do i really want to die yes and no if we didnt live in this fucked up world of course not but we do so fuck yeah i want to die i am certainly not encouraging others to do so this is my choice i believe my rights just like everyone else thinks their rights are normal you can put me on all the fucking meds you like that is not going to stop my reasoning and thinking that i feel i have the right to die i can actually attest to this i am on them now so my question is why dont we have euthanasia clinics for those who see no way out and have lost all hope not just those for elderly terminally i will why dont we have those rights we lived in a fucked up world everyone screams for their rights and are getting them but for those who are suffering they cant choose to die humanly people dont give a fuck about the homeless those that are depressed suffering with mental i willness if you are living in poverty even though you work hard and do your best they look down on you if you are just a cleaner welfare agencies dont give a fuck if your suffering and cant go on there is no support for you while others bludge off the system and get away with it for years and years the risk of surviving a gun shot wound if its not done right and obviously how to hang oneself is can not work and cause prolonged damage as i found out we need assitance to do so safely humanely without the need for other people to discover you with pieces everywhere or at the bottom of a cliff this world is fucked and upside down,suicide

method used in chris cornell and chester benningtons suicides i know this is kind of morbid but given that crime scene photos have leaked and that both were exceptionally interesting and beautiful human beings has anyone explained exactly how chester and or chris committed their acts of suicide i know both of them hung themselves with simple household items in chris case he used workout resistance bands in chesters case he used a belt in both cases it seems as though there was no significant drop and they therefore died via strangulation cutting off blood or choking cutting off air not via neck injury i ve always been under the impression that it was fairly difficult to make a reliable noose using these types of items in part bc of the high suicide failure rate particular among women and in part bc i ve never researched or thought about it too deeply however the fact that both chris and chester succeeded makes me think that creating a reliable device is easier than i realized and that many failed suicide attempts are not actual suicide attempts but rather deliberate failures as a cry for help i totally sympathize with both those who actually commit suicide and those who attempt suicide as a cry for help i ve desired the courage to carry out both types of acts in the past and can see how one may do such a thing ,suicide

unprepared for this peace to expire i ve thought about suicide and cried a lot todayi must have written and then deleted several pages of text by now so how about if anybody really wants to donate their time and energy to listening to me then ask me what you want to know and we can take it from there currently i have a reasonable comfortable existence for many many reasons my current living situation cannot last its with my parents i dont know of anybody else that would be willing to have me live with them when this uneasy compromise out of necessity ends knowing myself i think its likely that i will end up killing myself right now i dont want to kill myself if i did i wouldnt run the risk of spoiling my chances by telling somebody and i wouldnt use a method that has a chance of being interrupted or failing thats why its important that i talk about this now because i dont when i make plans,suicide
my parents are so strict all they want me to do is study and it makes me want to die have you talked to them about this you can bring it to their attention that this is a highly inefficient parenting method for trying to get you to make good grades,suicide
i just dont know what to do anymore have you ever felt you just have no other way out i do i just feel i have nothing left to live for and i know my mum would be so disappoint of who i have become i dont even know why i am writing on this maybe just to actually get the truth off my chest,suicide
a friend of mine wanted to kill himself at a party last saturday at a party i myself had struggle with suicide in the past but i found inspiration in the unexpected i never talked someone out of suicide and i hope i didnt make things worse i just wanted to share this to kinda take it out of my system and try to understand this whole situation from different perspectives,suicide
probably wont ever kill myself i think about it as an option every now and then but theni amlike well from an honest utilitarian perspective theres better options than the finality of death my death would hurt some people pretty much regardless of any other circumstances so i can live with my unhappiness maybe i can dedicate my life to helping others nah too much work well if my life is going nowhere i could join the military but i keep hearing that its really boring after training work that they dont need a human to do maybe i will just do what i like hah like i have that much dedication just live and work to pay for my survival while distancing myself from others to avoid hurting them i am too much of a pussy for that well shit,suicide
looking for an easy out i have no reason to be depressed and while i have never been clinically diagnosed i have bouts where getting out of bed is the hardest task i ve faced my life from the outside makes some jealous single good job nice car etc but i am worn i am a caretaker of someone close to me and i am the go to person for many friends i am a good listener and i believe i have set the precedent that i can listen but dont need to be listened to now for fear of the effects on my job and personal endeavors if i admit my suicidal desires it would cause additional stress that would be counter productive i dont want to commit suicide out of desperation or even dark depression i want to just because its easy logically i understand why i shouldnt but selfishly and truly selfishly i want to ,suicide

getting ducks in a row i feel like i ve run out of gas i ve been putting so very much energy into fighting my depression and ideations while trying so hard to help myself through transitioning months ago i had a week long vacation with my best friend planned we were going to gencon for the first time ever that very first day i had of of work i attempted to kill myself and feel i came close i was found by another suicidal friend and she with my best friend nursed me back i didnt want to survive and have been wrestling with that since i ve been crying and stuck on the couch since yesterday ive now cancelled plans this week and therapy appointments today i documented my assets and where i am intending them to go i ordered the second part of my suicide plan online and it arrives any day its been tough not being rash while i wait for the package and falling back to another method but i didnt follow my plan the first time suicidal friend had wanted previously to make a suicide pact with me but she doesnt know how bad off i am yet peace and i can only hope that those i hurt so much can themselves move on,suicide
i am still alive or why i cant die yet there are two reasons why i havent killed myself the first is that i dont want my mom to outlive me shes been through so much and worked so hard to be happy that i absolutely cant kill myself while shes alive i couldnt do that to her so thats reason 1 reason 2 is ridiculous i feel like i cant kill myself until ive done something worthwhile until ive succeeded at accomplishing something notable publishing a bestseller making a million in the stock market whatever something that justifies the fact that for a brief moment i was alive only when ive found that peace will i be able to die i absolutely refuse to kill myself now and die a failure id be fine killing myself if i were successful and theres that tiny sliver of hope an irrational hope trying to keep me alive by refusing to let me succeed does this make any sense good night,suicide
why cant i just turn life off everyday when i am trying to sleep i hope to not wake up it would be perfect i just cant understand so many things that it drives me crazy i just want to turn me off in a way that will not hurt my parents but even this is hard for me ,suicide

feeling clear i have felt suicidal for around 57 years i normally feel suicidal when i am very sad usually thinking of suicide as a way to stop being a burden on my family today i did not feel sad i felt very clear i felt like the best option for me was to disappear i do not feel like i can function in society i am ashamed of what i have done and how i have treated those who tried to love me i do not pity myself at all the condition i am in is all because of my own actions i feel certain that my life will not get any better although i couldnt possibly know that honestly i am afraid i feel disguting in my own body i feel like every second i spend in it is almost torturous,suicide
still here all i am doing right now is existing and going to school and tricking my mind into thinking that life is worth living for such and such passions which dont even make me feel any sort of excitement or happiness anymore i cant socialize trust me ive tried many many times i dont know what its like to be valued by someone else as much as i want to live to get rich and find happiness i have come to realize that the journey to seeking happiness is somewhat a false hope kind of thing and i figure that even if i reach my goals i still wont be any happier or any less lonelier than i am today besides i think being dead is better than suffering through every single second of my life my existence is literally pointless why not put an end to this ridiculousness,suicide

bullying and harassment at home it was just bullying and harassment bullied by peers parents and siblings i only wanted to die i knew i wanted death for a long time at this point but i was too scared i held a knife to myself many times but i was always too scaredi went through middle school and high school creating a facade that i was happy that i wasnt suffering from crippling depression everyone believed it including my family through middle school and high school i probably cried myself to sleep almost every night i had giant bags under my eyes which i still have to this day at 24 i would pray to god on a daily basis to kill me to end it all or help me end it all i went to a private catholic school before 7th grade and being young and impressionable i really believe in life after death i believe suicide will send me to hell which is somewhere i dont want to go i suffered so much in this life already how can i kill myself and go somewhere to suffer for eternity i dont know what i want out of writing this but i just really want to die so badlyi felt better in college i felt less alone but even having a gf or a few friends i still felt itmy baseline emotion at this point was crippling depressioni realized i dont know how to actually make friends i have had so so very few friends in my life i have no one to talk to and loneliness is killing meno one really knows but i partially joined the military after college in hopes of finding that connection people speak ofim looking for that now and i realize its just like anywhere else i still have trouble making friends and i really dont know how to fix it some people i just click with maybe like 1 out of 500 and the rest i just dont have anything to talk about i dont know what to say i dont want watch any sports i dont like that stuffi amweird and i always try and keep that happy facade uplately the loneliness and stress have just been adding up that i cant help but cry myself to sleep i just want a friend i just want someone to talk to i just want to die i pray to god that i can get into some kind of car accident where only i will get hurt and die i pray i can die in my sleep i pray to have a heart attack to get cancer to die some sudden death or get run over i pray that god takes the breath from my lungsi dont love anyone on this planet i have no desire to stay here i have no attachments all ive ever wanted in this life is to have my own family someone to love that loves me back and children to raise properly a real family not the bullshit hand i was dealtbut its hardmy parents let me eat like garbage growing up we never went out to eat but all i really ate was cheese and pasta my body never properly developed if you look closely my head is smaller than most males as is whats between my legs they are both closer to a childs my body even though people thinki ammuscular is soft and pudgy i am undeveloped my emotions are a mess my mind is a mess i dont know what to do with my lifei dont know whyi amwriting this or what i want i just know that if i was offered the opportunity to die i would take it in a heartbeat the only thing that stops me from killing myself is the fear i will go to hell but oh my goshi wish someone would kill me the loneliness and pain in my heart is so crippling it hurts living each day everyday i stop caring about hell just a little bit because i want to leave this world i want the pain to end i want the torrent of emotions in my mind to stopedit i think i know what i want i mean i want friends i want people to talk i want to be normal but i know that takes timefor a while i used to be good at taking my mind off these things and finding an escape but the crippling depression and desire to die has become too overwhelming it invades my every thought i want to know how i can get out of this i want it to stop until death can find me until i die i need these thoughts to be gone i know thats whats good for me but its just so hard when pain and mental despair is all you know,suicide
this is cross posted from the depression sub and also just because right nowi am not doing so well this is my storyi am34 years old and i have lived with depression for the last 18 years of my life each year it gets worse and worse there are days where i just do not want to get out of bed there are days wheni amoff from work that i do not get out of bed i just lay in bed eat junk and just watch tv or youtube all day long and frankly that is just what i want to do with my time off i dont want to do anything that is extra work i just feel drained and lazy most of the time from my depressionit hurts and what hurts even more is that i do not have anyone in my real life that seems to care i have come out with saying that i am depressed and all i got from my mother wasi am sorry you are sad sadness and depression are two different things she doesnt understand and she is not willing to understand she told me to snap out of it i cant snap out of itmy depression about four years ago really took a nose dive it got horrible and that was the day i learned about mom and dad getting a divorce they told me about it first thing in the morning on my 30th birthday it hurt it hurt a lot to tell me first thing in the morning about it all she didnt stop there she decided to tell me all about my dads new girlfriend and that i also had a new half brotheri felt rotten that entire day this is where people look at me really funny but i found something later that day that did make me happy and something that did make me smile or should i say someonei came home from work and i turned the tv on i sat there for a few moments in this kind of trance because i still couldnt believe what was going on in my life i was suddenly snapped out of that trance as i looked back at the tv the colbert report came on i had never seen it before so i gave it a shot the first thing that ran through my mind was oh he is cute but then later on as i watched it more i began to laugh and smile that was the first time i had smiled that day and in a long time i started to look forward to that feeling every daynow you may laugh at me plenty do ive been called weird and crazy for it franklyi amat the point now that i dont care that is the only thing i have to look forward to every day that is the only thing that keeps me going through the day is getting home and watching him before i go to bedafter a while i did develop a crush go figure anyways on to more about my adventures here i started to get a little bold and i would go to the dirty role playing subs here i would post ads for role plays of where i would want people to play him and help me play out some of my fantasies because i enjoyed that feeling and also it was just something else to engage my brain in something that kept me focused on something i like and not thinking about my depression more and feeling badbut that didnt work out the way that i wanted to it only gained the attention of trolls and they trolled me hard to so hard thati amnow banned from those subs they ruined something that i loved something that gave me a fucking reason to live because my fucking parents sure as hell dont do thathell this post might attract trolls and i know that was just an invite to be honest ive been crying as ive been writing out this post i was told by someone to just start a post here and just write write whatever came to my mind so here it is take it or leave it read it or ignore it laugh at me or dont chances are someone already has,suicide

boiling over ive always been very personal and private about my depression and anxiety i always wanted to keep it all to myself and maybe i could help someone by sharing my story but the time for that has never comei am not embarrassed of what ive done rather scared that no one would be able to look at me the same if they knew the first time i really tried to kill myself i took a handful of oxy and went for a drive expecting not to be able to react it was between 13am on a weekday in 2014 i drove my favorite canyon road by the time i got to the end of the road everything went black and i woke up a few hours later pulled over safelyi am not sure why i pulled over or why i didnt just let myself crash but i didnt the next year i spent most every day on some kind of hard drug intermittently trying to od but it never worked then january 5th of 2015 after a terrible acid trip and even more terrible interaction with people i thought cared about me i tried to end my life i wrote 6 letters to my sister my mom my dad and my 3 closest friends i snorted half a gram of ketamine drank 13 of a bottle of fireball and took all the valium that was prescribed to me that month about 60 pills and slit both my wrists i was living at home with my parents after dropping out of college my dad travels 3 or more weeks out of every month and my mom was staying with my grandmother who was dying and if my dad had time off hed stay with them in california and leave me with the house to myself my parents never knew of my addiction or how bad i had gotten back to january 5th my parents were home but used to me not leaving my room for days at a time and my mom busts into my room at around 3pm on the 7th and pulls open my blinds and yells that its time for me to do something anything and storms out of my room slamming my door and as unlikely as it may seem i came to my sheets were bloody the letters still sat on my night table next to my bed and my mom didnt even look at me or the slew of drugs and alcohol on my night table the only thing i remember from my attempted suicide was becoming very cold and seeing nothing but black until i saw just my own face emerging from the blackness i didnt interact with myself i didnt say anything or rather dont remember saying anything and the peaceful darkness of me staring at my own face in darkness was interrupted by my moms voice of her barging in my room for the next 4 months i went back to school and wore long sleeve shirts well into spring break when i finally slipped my family and i went out for family dinner and i wore a long sleeve sweater and as i reached across the table to grab something my mom saw my scarred wrist i had been waiting for them to heal enough so that i could get a tattoo to cover them up but they were badly scarred and unsightly i never told anyone what happened that night other than telling my mom i tried to kill my self months earlier i have never been afraid of death nor the repercussions of killing myself until my family sat me down and each of them told me how it would have affected them and how it would affect everyone that knew me this didnt scare me but made me feel terrible made me feel even more like a burden and i knew id never be able to escape their fears of me attempting again for the next year i got daily check ins from my family which inevitably slowed as the year progressed and finally the anniversary was upon me again and overwhelmed with emotion i attempted again however this time i just tried to od on sleeping meds and barbiturates i had been living with my best friends and their girlfriends in a house near my school and when i attempted i believe this was the closest i got to death i started having extreme trouble breathing my heart was racing my vision was blurry and i was terrified i made a last ditch effort to throw up some pills after i made myself throw up i passed out in my shower in my room again never told anyone and no one was the wiser that this had just occurredi am not sure how i could help anyone with this story but i always hoped that maybe i could help someone feeling like they cant go on like they are afraid every day that they could take their own life but the truth is i still feel that way after all the therapy ive gone through after all the experiences that have gotten me here i still have a daily thought about how id do it again about how i wont fail next time all the while trying to be there for my friends in their times of weakness and there for my family to try and be the goofy light hearted sonbrother theyd known its just not me anymore and its lonely knowing i have to keep these things to myself so i dont scare or put stress on those around me on those who still care about me ,suicide
me again not looking to be talked out of it this time i posted here before and was convinced not to end it allowing myself to be convinced was a mistake there are cliffs not far from where i live and i plan to throw myself off them at some point within the next week not looking to be talked out of it just wanted to tell someone whats happening 26 years is long enough and my relatives and friends will no doubt be much happier oncei amno longer there to burden them,suicide

i am alone i have a gun i need a dog my husband is out of town to meet up with some of his fraternity brothers for a football game at their alma mater no pets no kids i am too ashamed of my feelings to call anyone i am okay 80 of the time but i suffer from sporadic bouts of depression that include really intense suicidal thoughtsurges there is a loaded gun in the top drawer of my nightstand for protection my kitchen is full of knives my medicine cabinet has an industrial sized bottle of ibuprofen the liquor cabinet and wine rack hold enough for more than one person i have only told my husband about these feelings once i didnt want to he was driving us to family dinner at my parents house a little ways away and i started feeling the overwhelming sense of uselessness and wishing i didnt exist while looking at the cement construction barrier to my right i was taking deep breaths to calm myself but that isnt an instant fix the tears started pouring down my face and my husband not the most observant although super loving and supportive noticed he thought hed done something wrong he was worried i told him oh its stupid sometimes i get overwhelmed with feelings of uselessness and i feel like the world would be way better without me in it i will be fine it just takes awhile for these feelings to go away he assured me loves me and he would be devastated if anything ever happened to me as would my family my friends my coworkers would miss me and for sure one of my bosses would be absolutely lost without mewhen i was a teenager i would have really vivid dreams in which i would die in some new horrible fashion every night i am not exaggerating it was worse when i would workout its no different now at 28 my mind has gotten more creative it lures me into dreams where my life is perfect then little by little like picking flaking paint off an old door with your fingernails it starts to fall apart if i have a garden the plants start to die or turn poisonous slowly infecting the ground and working its thorny vines into my perfect house and tearing apart everything inside with an agonizing slowness i can do nothing to stop the vines wrap around me and hold me as my husband opens the door i try to scream to warn him but i amchoking they stab him through the heart and slowly crush me while he slumps against the door frame dying once hes dead the vines release me only to fell me with a similar blow before i can escape i die knowing that the vines will claim anyone who comes near the house to check on things when i wont answer my phone or my husband hasnt shown up at the office or responded to clients in days its my fault i planted the garden in high school i had pets lived with my parents and two sisters and had lots of friends nearbymy family is only an hour away but i dont want to let them know whats going on my husband is out of town and i dont want him to worry i have one friend in my new city and i dont know her all that well and i dont want her to thinki amcrazy i feel like someone is sitting on my stomach with one hand on my chest and the other forcing my face to look at the nightstand while listing off all my flaws fears shortcomings and failures i know what they want i know whats in the top drawer just inches below my hand thats gripping its top i am waiting for my sanity to come save me i am typing this hoping that part of myself that wants to live and knows that there is too much to do to die right now shows up soon the part that still isnt my biggest fan but holds way too much pride to let me fail too bad the side of me that says you really shouldnt do that its so weak selfish and shameful think of your mom think of your dad what would they do would you really put them through sorting through all your shit to find some clue you didnt leave your husband would be so ashamed how could he feel okay about having people over to comfort him with all this mess you should get up and clean something this is ridiculous not to mention youre overweight what would they bury you in none of your nice things fit anymore at least lose some weight and clean the house first we can revisit this theni need a dog not even a therapy dog just a dog feeding myself is not reason enough to get out of bed taking care of myself is not enough for me to go for a walk my need and my husbands need to live in a clean and healthy home is not enough to move from our bed but i do have a friend coming over tomorrow night shell definitely think i was crazy if i didnt call or answer the door when she got here if i had a dog though i would have gotten up hours ago to feed it and let it out i am not enough to live for but i have had a dog before that dog was my life i am living to get to a point in my life where it wouldnt be irresponsible or inconsiderate to get a dog life is too busy and uncertain right now and it wouldnt be fair to the dog but i really need one right now edit i need something external to push me from this place because that gun is really close and i am having trouble talking myself out of this edit2 so woke up totally fine thanks everyone who talked to me last night hopefully i wont be back here anytime soon posting about my suicidal thoughts i plan on coming back to help others going through similar situations ,suicide

this is the most i could do firstly if you are thinking of sending help please don t as much as i admire you re noble intentions it s much too late for me i ve tried getting help it s not meant to be as the mental health services as has my doctor have concluded that i m not unwell enough based on my past achievements also i ve not decided to end my life right away but rather i ll do it after i ve tied up a few loose endsi have been doing my research and my conclusion is that for me this will be best for me i m autistic i lost both my parents i was an only child and therefore i no longer have any family i was a full time carer for my mother for 15 years she was disabled and very sick but my efforts to save her failed i completed my duties as her carer and her son but these past two years living for myself brings me no purpose no happiness no hope just loneliness and a newfound drug addiction that brings me some comfort and pleasure in my lost existencedue to my aforementioned autism i have difficulty forming relationships as if being gay wasnt difficult enough people i do meet after talking to them online like the sound of me but don t actually like me in person and so don t give me a chance i m in my early thirties and i ve never been in a relationship that has made me happy including friendships i m also living with the effects of abuse i m no longer being abused however i find myself ruminating about the past and have never truly healed from itrather than suicide i see this as an act of euthanasia the first time i tried to accomplish this task it resulted in me laying unconscious for a few days in my house that i lived alone in it may not be a natural death but to me it feels natural either existence ceases or i ll be reunited with all the loved ones i lost and we can be a family again but one things for sure this is the end of my existence that i fought to exist in to the point of exhaustioni don t know why i m posting this i suppose just so there s a record of my thoughts out there somewherethank you for reading,suicide
i feel likei amcrazy i feel like i have something seriously wrong with me i cant tell if its just depression and anxiety anymore i dont feel right i dont enjoy anything anymore my head feels cloudy i feel jealous of other people all the time over small trivial things i can never express how i feel when i look at my selfies i look mentally disturbed i think thats iti ama very mentally disturbed person i lack empathy i lack the ability to see things through others eyes i waste all my time away doing nothing i have no goals i feel like i have no confidence in my abilities physically i always feel awkward as if my muscle memory doesnt existi amvery noncaring towards other people my family included idk i need to see a professional i feel so powerless as if nothing in my life matters i often worry about my health wondering why i have heart palpitations all the time and why i feel like i constantly have coldallergy symptoms honestlyi amafraid to go to the doctors becausei amafraid i have cancer or some terminal i willness sometimes i worry its cancer in the brain and thats why i havent felt like myself for so long i have very little control over my thoughts i have very little control over my facial expression i just dont knowi amreligious i believe when we die we go somewhere better with that in mind i just think whats the point in living ifi ameventually just going to die anyways and in all likelihood that death will be horribly painful and gruesome life just feels likei amwaiting for that horrible terrifying moment nothing seems to matter when things do seem to matter they just dont stick i cant stop questioning my worth skill and abilities i feel like i can sympathise with people who commit mass shootings not that i would ever do something so terrible but i feel like i know how those people felt they felt useless and defeated nihilistic and jealous filled with a kind of hatred towards the world and other people not because of something other people did to them but because of the toxic feelings other peoples lives brought about within themselves they stopped caring they snapped i will never snap but i sympathize with how those killers felt the average person writes them off as crazy they werent crazy they were just mentally weakened by their own thoughts and life experiences idk this whole thing is nonsensical it feels like today there is a boulder resting on my body a metaphysical boulder that only i can see and feel ,suicide

i dont know man my story is pretty pathetic ive dug myself this social hole where i literally have no one and no one will even approach me i had one good friend and she got upset with me because she didnt want to hear about my problems anymore and so i stopped bringing them up but i was struggling so much i couldnt talk to anyone and she gave up on me and hates me now i had a girlfriend and she honestly made the world light up for me and then she broke up with me and now ive got nothing left ive been on a downward spiral for over a year and i just feel so alone i have nothing going for mei amconsidered gifted but my motivation has run so dry that i can barely pass a class and i amuseless at basically any life skillsi am going no where in life and it hurts because i just need someone to be there for me i cry myself to sleep every night and no one could give less of a shit about me the only reason i havent killed myself yet is because i cant figure out a way to make it quick and painless i just want the hurting to end i dont want to cause morei dont even know what i hope to achieve by posting this i just want to shout my problems into the void so maybe someone will hear me,suicide

flashback i just looked at the knife block in my kitchen and i remembered a time when i was 11 or 12 or maybe younger but i grabbed a knife and i was holding it on myself because i wanted to die and that was when i was a kid and now i m hardly an adult and it s all making me cry,suicide
i am going to try to express myself honestly because i dont know where to turn right now please forgive the lengthsome context i am 19 i am a man and i am in college i have been struggling with depression social anxiety and suicidal thoughts for 3 and 34 years i have been hospitalized 3 times and been involved with some form of therapy for a large part of that time period i attempted suicide once and almost attempted quite a few times thereafter i went to college at 18 and these same feelings resulted in me losing my scholarship and being forced to transfer closer to home damni amprivileged as shiti feel likei am going insane because of how quickly i fly from a really good mood to planning my suicide these past few days have been rough with this chemistry lab that i keep missingi amalmost certain that i dont have bipolar but the thought of untreated diagnoses or of mistreated diagnoses scares the shit out of mei amalso afraid of getting involved with medicine becausei amafraid of what my parents would think since they seem to think thati am doing better even thoughi am still having similar problems as the last college i also dont want to mess with meds while my attendance at my current college is so tenuous i am on academic probation you see i wouldnt want to jeapordize the future while trying to get betteri am really lonely and meeting new people make me extremely uncomfortable i am so afraid that they would reject or ridicule me for experiencing depression and anxiety as incessantly as i do even though i recieved positive responses from everyone ive shared this with except my parents the social anxiety gets to the point where i wont leave my room unless i know my roommates arent there because i dont want them to see me and my sordid condition the fact that i am anxious makes me so upset that i think about killing myself because i dont see myself ever getting past it even though i have made considerable progress since a year ago it still feels likei am going nowhere and i know thats emotional reasoning but it still hurts so much when it feels like ive made no progressi get furious and hopelessly sad to the point of tears when i see people who are doing better than me like my roommate said i shouldnt compare my chapter 1 to what could be someone elses chapter 20 but i feel so angry at myself and everyone else when i see people who seem socially capable when i cant even look strangers in the eye on the way to class i also feel so upset when i hear people tell me that it will get better because they really dont know it could always get a lot worse and then i could finally kill myself they sound so goddamn presumptuous as if they dont know how condescending that sounds it makes me feel so broken and stupidcan i talk about how hopeless i feel i am really concerned as you might imagine i dont have a significant other i feel hopeless about ever forming that type of relationship with someone because my depression social anxiety and suicidal thoughts are things that will never go away for me and i ampretty sure that no one would want to start a relationship with someone like that so it follows that i have thoughts that i will never be able to form that kind of relationship while being honest about how i feel to that other person i feel likei ama quivering baby that no one could feel anything for but pity i feel likei ama broken egg trying to hold myself together and i ampretty sure that i have to be more secure in myself before those kinds of relationships of course the perpetual nature of my bad mental stuff leads me to believe that i will never be secure in myself and that i can never get a significant otheri knowi amyoung but ive made a lot of mustakes that make me wish i had jumped off of rhe manhattan bridge when i had the chancei am really afraid to talk to my two close friends about this because i want to respect that they have problems too i also get distorted thinking that leads me to believe that no one really cares and no one wants to hear my problems i mean in a way it is true insofar as no one wants to hear the bad news of heyi amfaring very poorly but i also understand thay theyd rather recieve that bad news than the worse news of hey your friendacquaintance temporalindifference has been found dead by suicideits just so damn hard for me to think clearly when i feel as bad about myself as i doand of course as with a lot of my type the only time i can escape any of these feelings is eheni amplaying video games masturbating listening to music or painting my wh40k figurines ei things that i can do alone and as we all know none of these are good reasons to live in themselves so i get this creeping sense of delaying my inevitable suicidei remember seeing this question on this therapy intake form that said something like how likely do you think you are to die of suicide it was a question i have never heard before and maybe i misread it i feel like my suicide is as inevitable as my depression is chronic,suicide
its just too much to bear anymorei am too weak for this i was not cut out for living in this existence i was never meant to be here i dont belong here i am too weak there is no place for me here my emotions are too strong for me to bear i cannot go on living like this the pain is too much i am nothing fuck everything make it end please,suicide

i don t really feel anything i just want to die i can t do anything i need to do and i think it s more practical to give my body back to the earth than to live on hurting it more and fighting off the inevitability of death i crack smiles and i participate in meaningless conversations with my parents and people at school but it s not me it s just the shell of the human i m keeping alive when the actual person inside me wants to die i cried when i first considered seriously killing myself again but i cried for maybe 30 seconds and then i went numb and now i m here i ve already attempted to take my life once in the year following i has motivation to live i had emotions that made me feel warm and strong and now it s all gone and i just feel like a void i m losing weight because i have no desire to eat and no motivation to get help from family or friends or medical professionals i don t even know how i d bother to kill myself because i m in such an apathetic state,suicide
i just tried to kill myself i tied the belt around my neck and the top of my dresser i wanted to know if i could go through with iti am too tall to fully hang so i relaxed my body and closed my eyes within a couple of seconds my arms and legs were tingling and i started to fade out my brains natural reaction was to stand up and save myself after some googling i found out that if i had waited just a couple more seconds to go unconscious i wouldve died within 20 minutes no one would know i live alone in an off campus university apartment my girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me and said she just didnt want to be in a relationship right now and that down the road we could try again i know shes lyingi amoverwhelmed with university things and i can barely take care of myself at my apartment i wish i wouldve gone through with killing myself its the only solution i have to all my problems ,suicide

its all downhill from here long i went to one of the best high schools in my state i got okay grades made some friends and generally just tried to get through school unnoticed i was depressed for most of high school but i never had any suicidal ideations just selfharm i went to a local college where i was going to study engineering it wasnt my first choice since stem subjects arent my specialty but it was what my parents suggested so i went with it i did poorly in my first semester and had a few suicide attempts i stood on a balcony of a tenstory building several times but never got the nerve to jump when i came home for christmas my parents were mad at me for hiding my poor grades from them and i became even more depressed i stayed in bed most days during the spring semester and ended up trying to overdose in april i panicked and called 911 ending up in a psychiatric hospital it was a shitty place and i hope to never go there again my parents found out about my suicide attempt and i told them about my depression so they decided to send me to a therapistpsychiatrist they werent very helpful but i got some meds that at least helped me get out of bed i went back to school in the fall for accounting which my counselor recommended i try after taking an aptitude test school went just as poorly as it had previously though and it was a repeat of last years christmas break i went back to school in the spring but did poorly again this summer i got a customer service job and dropped out of college ever since ive been lying to my friends and convincing themi am still at college even though they never see me on campusif you bothered to read that whole story youve probably noticed a pattern in my life of things getting worse i was always told i could do great things but here i am at 20 going to work at a grocery store at 5 am i dont see my life getting better from here so i only see two possible futures one is where i live out the rest of my life working crappy jobs and leeching off of other people i disappoint everyone around me for decades until eventually i die miserable and alone alternately i kill myself now those closest to me will probably suffer a bit mourn for a little while but eventually theyll move on their lives will continue without me as a burden on them i will be free from worrying about the future and having to deal with my mistakes one of these futures is much more enticing than the other and i amrunning out of reasons not to choose the latter just looking for some outside opinions on what i should dotldr my life is awful and its easier to die now than live in suffering for decades so why not just end it,suicide

i read something here the other night and i amafraid it inspired me first time posting 20somethingfi amthe first person to sayi am not suicidal but man am i depressed and feel better off dead i read a post i found in the depths somewhere the other night it was from a train operator requesting people not kill themselves by means of the railroad because of the trauma it inflicts on the operator while i understand that this post finally gave me what i was a looking for how i can surely end my lifei have been struggling for normality and comfort in my life for quite sometime after my life suddenly crumbled to a pile of constant spontaneous combustioni am not really sure where to begin there if someone asks i will share but i could honestly write a book as the world turns in my universe and people would think i was a good writer ive been seeing a psychologist for almost 3 years now she is very helpful but she cant change my chemical imbalance and she certainly cant fix the shithole that is my life i am scared now though because it is sinking in more and more that this is who i am for life i currently live with a railroad in my backyard i literally mean it would take all of 30 seconds to be on the tracks and dead once i heard or saw a train the fantasy of this is so fucking freeing but dont even get started on the nightmare of its reality tldr i am pretty confident i wont lay down on the railroad tracks or kill myself at all but i have fallen in love with the idea of doing so ,suicide

its just so funny i can post on and get no responses no upvotes at all but plenty of views i post here sayingi amgonna end it all and all of a sudden theres an outpouring of support and people telling me to contact them if i need to saying i need to reach out and get help etc etc etc and its the same shit offline too you tell someone youre depressed and sad and its like yeah okay but when are you but as soon as you say you wanna kill yourself people suddenly care its all for selfish reasons too no one wants to be the one who ignored a suicidal person but its fine to brush off someone before they get to that point like yall do realize that feeling alone and helpless is what pushes people to that point right,suicide

first time having suicidal thoughts my depression started when i realized what was happening with me during my childhoodhighschool period my parents were always treating me as if i m not capable of doing things or useless thinking they are doing good thing to me they would presume that i was going to fail or trying to do the work for me to this day they still treat me like i m useless piece of shit and because of that i had never really tried anything to do to prove them wrong because i dont want to prove anyone wrong about something like that recently i ve passed my last exam on my uni i was doing a project in a programing language an online shop my mother was angry on my brother because he didnt do the project for me when she heard i passed she couldnt believe it i have no motivation to be good at anything ive been brought down so many times i feel likei amalone in this and its really hard when your closest cant give you support you need they dont trust me and my skills they keep reminding me of my homework or anything that i have to do because they think i m unable to do it by myself to be responsible for something the moment i passed my last exam i felt huge depression because i expected atleast from my closest a littlebit of faith in me i proved them wrong and that i m capable of doing something right but i dont care about that as i already said i want to prove to myself and i find my parents attitude extremely distracting and demotivatingi am too scared of failing anymore i feel like i wouldnt take it good if i failed i have no selfesteem no faith in myself this wouldnt bother me so much if i wasnt actually capable of doing well payed things like programing suicide came across my mind because i m scared of ending up with minimal wage job with all the wasted potential i think i would kill myself if i end up like that i ve spent my whole life thinking that everyone else was better than me ,suicide
amjust so tired ive been suicidal for a little over a decade everyday i think about killing myself without fail obviously on good daysweeks i hear that thought in my head and just shrug it off but the bad daysjust keep piling on and keep getting worse and worseim just tired tired of everything tired of continuing life because its selfish of me to end it how is it selfish of me to want this pain ive been feeling for the majority of my life to stop but not selfish of to condemn me for feeling this way because dont want me to diei cant handle this right now any of this and i just feel like everything is closing in on me this strange feeling that my life is coming to a close soon i try to try and let it all out but no matter what i can only muster up a few tears after years of suppressing emotions and tears and sadness i think i broke myself and i think the end is in sightall i ever wanted was to feel happy ,suicide
my only reason to live is to not hurt others with my own death i don t really know where else to turn about this i ve been suicidal for years now and i m tired of people telling me that it s going to get better when the sad thing is that things haven t and things don t appear able to improve in the future honestly in most of my life situations it just seems like god is a cruel little kid who builds me up for excitement only to follow it up with extreme disappointment and sadness sometimes within the hour it s starting to feel really fucked up i just want a win for once in my life it dawned on me last night that the only reason for me to not go ahead and just end my life is the effect it would have on my family which means my only purpose is to just exist in pain and not cause any to others i don t want to hurt my mom with my death but i really don t think i can do this for much longer i know this all sounds so selfish but i m just looking for a reason to live has anyone else felt this way before how did you overcome it what have you found to give you purpose and not fall into the void,suicide
meet them where they are here is one of the few safe places that people can come and talk openly about suicide without judgement and in theory without eliciting an immediate emotional response that blocks that person from expressing their feelingsthe responses here are obviously going to be different to the responses that would be received by or made by the people that come here in real life in a non professional face to face settingi would be the first to admit that if i suffered a tragedy tomorrow i wouldnt be in the best place to be here and be presentand thats exactly the point its the realisation that its not that simple as thinking count yourself lucky because oh my you dont think that people destroy themselves that they cant think like that that they dont scream at themselves to stop feeling the way that they dohere it is safe and we meet them where they are we join them in their despair even with the knowledge that we may not be able to make anything better but offering that space and time may be the one thing that is needed and that nobody else has ever done for themit is in fact a very precious thing to be able to offer yourself to just be with somebody else and fully present to themamy,suicide
i wanna just kill myselfi am so tired of life the only thing that keeps me going are small things like video games food and enjoying laying in bed i dont want that to end and thats it everything else doesnt mean shit because i dont have anyone maybe a few friends but they dont understand depression or anything and they dont help at all i guess they would care if i killed myself but so many people say that and i feel like its only because they feel bad and want to cheer me up or something but it doesnt i have tried to kill myself before but i made sure i was only hospitalized because it was a cry for help so people would take me seriously yet people still dont but when i do kill myself people will all miss me and act like they cared and tried to help right i hate school too ive failed 9th grade twice and i amfucking stupid and i cant take it teachers treat me like garbage because they know ive failed twice and overall lowers my already non existant self esteem i hate how i look and how my body is its never as good as any other guys i dont have abs or anything special at all girls barely even acknowledge i exist and girls who i have dated either cheated on me or left leaving me to think they just felt bad for me my family treats me like a disappointment too i dont wanna drop out but i feel like i have to or else i will be in high school forever sorry if this isnt that organized just needed to rant or something because i cant handle this for much longer ,suicide
please tell me what is wrong with me i know i already have a lot of obvious problems like my appearance my weight my race my sexuality my intelligence and my lack of talent or skill but is there something deeper wrong with me when i tell my mom i love her she always likes to say you dont love me you just love what i do for youshes been saying that for a long time and shes right of coursei am21 with no job no high school education and i sit on my ass all day doing nothing while she works but i dont know if i actually dont love her i dont know if i love anyonei became more curious about this today when i was talking with a friend and he said he doesnt think i will ever be happy and that i dont care about anything he knows me pretty well so hes probably right also but i dont want to end up like that i dont think i have a choice thougheven though i knowi am so fucked up and worthless and everythingi amnever going to do anything about it i dont even shower or brush my teeth or anything i dont clean or cook maybe i just dont give a shit about anything maybei amincapable of truly loving anyone maybe i should just dieits stupid of me the post this and none of you will have a magic solution i doubt anyone will even read all of this and reply but i guess it makes me feel a bit better to do it,suicide

i dont really understand hi i just felt like posting my thoughts somewhere sincei amfeeling a bit down and a tad bit introspective ive decided to share a bit of my life with the internet which i know isnt exactly the smartest thing but heyi amhere might as wellokay so ive been suicidal and depressed on and off for a couple of years now i cant exactly tell you when it started since problems like this usually stem from childhood issues but i can say that it certainly started getting worse sometime around grade seven or eight now ive been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder ocd and severe depression but i am not currently seeing any therapist due to my parents disbelief in mental i willness i think that they might not want to believe that their daughter has any type of problem at all or maybe this all ties into their general ignorance of things i dont hate my parents but i dont really believe in their values theyre racist homophobic my dad is sexist and my mother uses religion to justify everything she does okay back to me like i said i have a couple of mental issues with my depression and ocd probably being the worst of the bunch my ocd is very very disruptive of daily lifei am not particularly religious but i am not an atheist i am a 16 soon to be 17 year old girl and my sexuality is homosexual though i dont like the term lesbian very much due to its oversexualized connotation i like pretty boring stuff like writing reading and drawingi amparticularly interested in writing and i would like to become an author and hopefully slow down the death process of modern literature yeahi ama stud arent i i have relationship issues with my girlfriend but i wont get into that hereright now in a general reference to daily life i feel nothing nothing i can particularly say my emotions are somewhat normal if a bit exaggerated in the moment but on an overarching scale i feel fairly empty even so ive been thinking about killing myself i used to think that i gave up cutting after having a little dispute with my mother over the scabbylines on my wrist its been about two years since then and ive started cutting up my thighs on an almost daily basisi am not like one of those edgy teens where i cut because of the physical pain distracts from the emotional pain i think its simply because of the dopamine reward my brain gives me for doing something good ive just always had a slightly high pain tolerance and i find myself attracted to the pair of sharpened scissors hiding away in my desk drawer last night though i had used a different pair they were the closest thing to me at the time and i ended up cutting myself a nice little and by little i mean huge gash right across my thigh i almost thought i needed stitches for a second i remember the initial spark of pain and then there was nothing it wasnt the numbness of a severed nerve no it just didnt i pressed down on it to stop the bleeding no pain i could feel myself pressing down but it just wasnt accompanied by any pain it was an almost surreal experience for me thats got me thinking i havent killed myself out of fear for the pain since i live in canada with no guns and i have no access to tall buildings and i dont own a car or have access to any potentially lethal pills the only viable method of killing myself that i have are the knives in my kitchen i had held one against the throat in the past but never had the guts to bring it down i have imagined stabbing myself in the stomach on multiple occasions but could never actually pull a knife that leads me to wonder about slitting my wrists ive heard of how painful it is but right now i cant really find myself caring i dont particularly care about anything at all school is easy i have nineties in every class and i havent studied a single day in my life i dont ever have any homework to worry about because i finish it all in class with time to spare i have enough friends to satisfy me and a girlfriend to keep me occupied romantically though i cant really comprehend sexual or romantic attraction so its more or less another form companionship to me and other than my earlier sediments on my parents i dont have a particularly bad home life my career as an author and english teacher is but a givenin fact for other people i might have an amazing life i just cant what phrase would be correct here comprehend yeah i guess i just cant the meaning of life sure i can understand the complex inner workings of society and the average human psyche my marks in social studies and psychology prove just that i just find myself unable to understand simple things why is that person happy why is society working away like sheep why am i who i amam i even who i amwho am ii amright then why does it sound so foreign to me why does my body feel like its not actually there i will look at objects pets or people in my life and wonder how they have been there my entire life they look so new and foreign to me i cant understand them in the slightest if i cant understand living then how am i supposed to live am i a sociopath or am i a normal human being simply going through a phase of introspection while my brain is developing into that of an adults could this be some kind of side effect of constantly reading and writing or is there something very very wrong with mei cant understand life so i want to die i cant understand death either so does that mean i have nowhere to turn to then it comes down to the original question should i kill myselfi amim kinda leaning towards a yes here i dont really know how to end something like this honestly i would be surprised if anyone even made it this far thank you for reading my little tale and let me tell you that each and every word here is true these words come from the very bottom of my souli really dont understand anything do i ,suicide

even when things are going relatively well i would rather just not livei am20 years old and a couple courses away from a community college diploma in accounting which can be transferred to give me half of the credits for a bachelorsi was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when i was about 13 but i never went on medicationi have had good times and bad times over the past few years it seems that recently the bad times have been getting more frequentsome courses in school give me no problem at all i aced things like financial accounting but if i have to write anything i will probably failfrom the time i was 9 i remember struggling to write stories in class now days tell me to write a memo essay or even something short and i just cant do it i have tried dictating it but that doesnt help i feel i just dont have the ideas in my head to put on paper even when i had to write physics lab reports i found it impossibledue to this i dont think i will ever be able to finish university and i cant handle working somewhere like a grocery store for my whole lifei amfrom canada but this yeari amspending a year abroad in belgium as an au pair i met my girlfriend in a community jazz band while she was taking a gap year in canada and i followed her back to belgium about a month ago she is so amazing and probably the one thing keeping me from falling into a deep depression and seriously considering suicide right nowi have one day a week totally free and i basically slept the whole day i should be exploring belgium 0 or at least go for a walk down the street i talked to my girlfriend and she has been supportive and is trying to help me get out of the house but i find it impossible some days are okay yesterday i went to audition for a choir and it went fairly well she is a very motivated person and i amscared that me doing nothing could pull us aparti also start things with a great deal of motivation but it typically fades quickly and i want to quit this happens with things like school sports work and any other type of activity really it happens even if it is something i really like i just find it hard to drag myself to iti need to figure out how to finish school i need to figure out how to stay motivated be able to tolerate my job and stop being such a negative person all the timeright nowi am really freaked out because i dont know how i can get through all of this i dont know what i will do with my life i have this year to figure things out then i have to go back to canada we did a few months already but a long distance relationship will be its own challenge and face reality i can stay with my mom as long as i am going to school i am thinking maybe i should push through the 3 courses and get my diploma as a checkpoint i was just going to go to university and go straight for my bachelors as i still get the transfer credits but i dont have a clue what i should do after that i think i should probably talk to a professional again i most likely shouldnt wait untili amback in canada but doing it here in belgium is intimidatingthanks,suicide

since july 29th this year ive been thinking about suicide and that i will do it this year still havent gone to it but will probably do it before christmas i didnt know when it started but about 45 years ago i started to hate myself a lot my first suicide attempt was when my parents fought i just grabbed a knife to stop them from fighting saying that i will kill myself yesi amhorrible but i actually wanted to kill myself that time they asked me whats wrong i answered that i didnt know but i actually know that i hate myself after that my mom kept telling her friends about that as if i cant hear it i never attempted suicide after that but i can still feel the depression and selfhate slipping in then this year happened i almost left home but my parents stopped me and i told them what i actually feel inside i told them that i hate myself and i just kept scratching on my arms i told them i have mental health issues then a week later i accidentally pushed my cousin was pissed off and my parents scolded me i whispered something about my mental health issue and how it couldve affected my thinking but my parents didnt believe me i had a fucking mental breakdown in front of them and yet they think thati am still joking now my mom said something about us being a perfect family since theyre not like those other parents out there who doesnt care about their children and she told me that theyre not the problem i am like for the past 5 years ive known that i am the problem i have a problem i actually thought that they would at least help me but they shrugged me offi ama covert narcissist and i hate that i wanted to change but i cant i cant i cant do this alone thats why i told my parents everything ive felt but i actually dont trust them anymore i dont want to talk to them about my feelings i dont need them to understand i just need them to listen but i could already see that they wont i can see iti amplanning on leaving suicide notes on this laptop and various other placesi amalso hinting on facebook about it i just wanted my parents to save me but i guess they cant i will just save myself from this misery,suicide
i cut myself again for the sixth time in four weeks ive been sobbing into my pillow for the last ten minutes because of it and everything else in my life i wish the people in my life actually understood what depression is actually like among other things i just want out why did you start cutting yourself make sure you keep it clean getting an infection would suck many people cant really handle the concept of suicide i think society is messed up but this subreddit can help at least a bit ,suicide

thinking about giving up so i really screwed myself i am going to completely fail a class i cant drop i have tried moving heaven and earth to get out of this class but nothing can be done i feel like ive ruined my futurei amsupposed to be transferring soon but i think thats all over ive essentially lived for my gpa it was one of the only things keeping me going but nowi am so lost i want to end it all even though i know its stupid and selfish i cant talk to anyone about this and its eating me alive i dont know how long i can keep going anymore i just want to sleep forever,suicide
didnt hang myself because i got spooked out i just think its best for me to go why is even suicide this hard ive just got home from going out to kill myself i had scouted my area for places to hang myself for weeks now and thought i found an adequate spot now so i went there past 2am with my rope to end this misery but upon arriving ive noticed that the path leading to the place i was heading to was not lit by street lamps already gave me a bad vibe but okay time to turn on the torchlight on my phone after a few metres in i got spooked really bad by a tree i mistook for some slendermanesque man and after catching my breath by some animal in the bushes that was to much for me so i went back home everything seemed so unreal like a real life psychedelic horror movie until i got back homei ama bit dissappointed with myself as killing myself would be the best way out of my misery but its not really easy if the sorrow and neuroticism that consumes you transfers into your suicide plans and makes you fear failure to off yourself on the first tryi am not even depressed or feeling sad right nowi am in a pretty neutral state of mind but thinking about myself suicide seems like the logical thing to do i will now read into death by exsanguination as for my bathroom is lit even at night,suicide

reddit causing suicidal thoughts help i want to start this by stating that ive been diagnosed with ocd by psychologists but have always refused to take meds this tendency towards compulsive thought and regret seems to stem from the many tumultuous and dark times i have been through in my short and inconsequential life two days ago i indulged in selfharm for the first time i have a girlfriend and she loves me dearly i know she would be devastated if i were to end my life but these thoughts seem to obscure any enjoyment for life that i used to have i dont know how long i will lasti for the first time in my life am considering suicide over a reddit post theres an old reddit post that contains my personal info and shows up when my name is written into google i am an extremely anxious person with a proclivity towards obsessive and compulsive thought the post in question is immature in nature and theres something about my name showing on the internet on such a post that makes my heart sink thinking i will never get a decent job and everyone will take me for a fool and if youre wondering under what form my name appears it appears in a screenshotive tried reaching out to admins twice and they seem to turn a blind eye to the fact thati amthinking of ending my life over this they give me the runaround your full name does not constitute personal information which i would say it does i mean what is there thats more personal than your full legal name also where do you draw the line a human being is telling you hes suffering and thinking of pulling the plug on his life yet some old insignifcant post except for me because finding it is a matter of typing my name thats gathering dust somewhere on the backpages of redditive tried reaching out to the guy who made the post he agreed to help me and deleted his account shortly thereafter before i was able to provide him with the link thats been plaguing my mind for the past 2 monthsi amassuming he thought deleting his account would translate into all his old posts being deleted ive tried everything that came to mind left no stone unturned and have not succeeded in finding a good samaritan that would help alleviate my pain my life is in a dark place to begin with and this is starting to feel like the straw that will break the camels back can anyone help me or advise me on what to do anyone know an admin that will take pity on me ,suicide

suicide option is liberating i know this sounds odd but it was so liberating when i determined that suicide was a realistic option for me now if i lose my job rather than trudge through the public embarrassment of losing my home and my family have to give up the cushy lifestyle we have now or making them move to a strange city there is a plan b suicide i kill myself and my family gets an instant financial windfall more than i could provide in 10 years so this realization has freed me up nowi amlike fuck it i started my own business on the side because if it fails who cares at worst i kill myself which is an option at best i am successful and can make my wife and kids proud of me knowing that i can always kill myself has also freed me up in how i deal with people too ive cut my abusive father out of my life because well why not if all goes to shit because i cut him out i just pull the plug and end itodd way to look at it but knowing that the worst thing that can happen is i die has liberated me in a way that nothing else has not thati amencouraging anyone to commit suicide get help your life is worth living even if mine one day wont be,suicide
been a while trigger i use to vent on here and the depression r reddit alot and for some reason id get alot of rude people commenting on my post but anyways i cant say that things have improved i had a rough time with the system when i started counseling last year i believe i dont know my mind is hazyi had two horrendous experiences with my first two counselors and during this my father got sick and passed away then i was told that i couldnt go there for counseling anymorelater on my significant other left me and i suffered until i reconnected with my close friend again and they helped me seek counseling but during this i got involved with someone who was bad for my mental health and i ended up overdosing again a few timesmy friend was supportive at first but they seemed to have burned out and i amunsure if my current counselor really cares about helping mei dont really have much faith in the system after everything that ive been through,suicide
amjust apathetic whats the point of being herei amjust here to make other people happy so long story short i had a boyfriend that i was crazy about i was actually happy for once in my life and felt like life had purpose we broke up after a year and a half about two months ago he told me that he wanted to marry me he almost proposed hes now dating another girl for a month now and has told her he loves her and wants to marry her i am not naive to think he really loves her the idiot just cant tell the difference between love and infatuation regardless hes still a happy idiot and i ammiserablesoi am going through the process of grieving i went crazy and was very close to killing myself the only reason i didnt is because of my familyi amgetting better ive had moments where ive accepted it and am ready to move on but the thing is i think this is the besti amgonna be until i find someone else like this is basically how i was before i met him just pretty apathetic about lifei amstarting to make friends and trying to better myself but for what so i can force myself to tolerate this life so i dont kill myself to keep other people happyi am in law school and i am trying to focus on the material and do the readings but i amfalling behind because i just dont care anymore i have to force myself to do this so i can get a job to support myself one day so i can tolerate this life sweetyeah maybe i will meet someone else one day that makes me feel happy like my ex did but what happens when he leaves too like my ex almost proposed to me everyone in my family loved him i thought everything was great between us then bam hes fallen out of love with me like fuck how am i supposed to trust after that and whats shittier is that i still miss him i tell myself over and over that i dont but i do i would probably take him back even though i tell myself over and over that i wouldnt or what if i never meet someone that makes me feel that way again thats whati ammost afraid of if i wanted to be in a relationship again i could just none of the guys have had that spark that i had with my ex i dont know what that spark is but i amaddicted to it like i literally could never get tired of being around my ex like i almost wish i was the kind of person who needed some space because i probably wouldnt be so fucked in the head but i could literally spend every moment with that person and feel happy of course theres fights and its not always roses but even the shitty times with him are better than these apathetic moments life felt like it had purpose now it feels like theres no point now its just me surviving and putting on a smile so other people arent sad which i mean i get it itd be selfish of me to trade my apathy for their sadness but this isnt fulfilling this is just being another number in the world i wish i just never existed that way no one could be sad over me because they never would have known me and i wouldnt hurt because i never would have known what life is i wish i wouldnt have screwed things up with him yeah he didnt buy me presents or do things that i wanted to do and thats shitty that makes me a pushover and pathetic but i was still happier being a pushover than i am for trying to have standards for myself we arent going to talk ever again we arent friends on facebook anymore and he blocked me on instagram the only communication i have left with him is just seeing his name pop up on the list of people who have viewed my snapchat story and you know how pathetic i am it makes my whole day when i see his name there its why i go out and try to have a life so i can post pictures on there and so hell see them and then i feel depressed until hes looked at it its pathetic and sad but thats what i am ,suicide

not a goodbye just an acknowledgement hello i am relatively new to reddit and its a bit sad to say its because of this subreddit i have finally decided to become an active user not in the sense that this subrredit led me to becoming suicidal more in the sense that ive come to this website more and more to escape from my life and today was the culmination of all of it because ive found a place where i dont have to lie or pretend to be someonei am noti ama compulsive liar i suspect that is so because i want to retain a sense of control over my life but that is a topic for another time i still dont feel comfortable enough to post my own story here not that i dont trust the people here its just difficult for me posting something so personal somewhere so public which i know is paradoxical because its a public anonimity and everyones intention here is to help or to seek out helpfor themselves but still i have a hard time showing my own wounds to anyone but me in the mirror that sounded really cringy sorry about that what i really wanted to do in this post is to commend everyone that put time away just so they could help others that are going through similar situations the energy you guys dispense is your own you are sharing these beautiful sincere and absolutely touching messages of togetherness and understanding that you can hear these scattered individuals silent screams and that they sound unfortunately familiar to a lot of other peoples your fight is your own but the pain you feel is close to somebody elses that loneliness that separation everyone who has ever had something like this in their lives has gone through that feeling of an especially made pain for you dont hold on to it dont nurture it remember that many have beaten it so can you so can i so can everyone in this subreddit i am typing this message for you guys because you too deserve support i know for a fact youve saved lives but unfortunately people dont recognize you much for it and i know that is not the point nevertheless i admire your courage and perseverance you are amazing thank you for the ones in more precarious situations the ones that write or read for support of their own i have a bit of advice some days ago i was feeling especially down so i decided to walk alone i talk to myself a lot so i kept reciting these sad mumblings about my life to myself i just know that at some point i started to run with tears going down my face and with me just insulting life in general it helped there was a lot i had inside of me and fortunately it helped i have been worse than this bound to my bed empty and cold i can feel that coming back in those times i tried suicide never managed to go through but i ambeing completely honest what kept me going was a violent hatred for life fear and selfdoubt i dont have any selfconfidence so i just kept questioning my decisions strangely enough that helped me get through that rough patch the conclusioni am trying to reach is dont feel inadequate for your sadness dont feel like a coward for being afraid and dont feel like its your fault life is shit i know its easier said than done but truly remember you your body your mind whatever you want its fighting for you to stay alive your knowledge of your situation may help you help others your pain can one day become a strength unlike anybody elses if so many have battled through you can too youve taken a beating now use that blood to uh idk fucking skate over and punch life straight in the dick and if you need just come back herem and we will remind you why life is better than what it feels like much strength my dudes and wish me some too,suicide

when you are the source of your problems most often people want to kill themselves because of problems coming to them like abuse bullying i willnesses etc but how do you cope when your problems are caused by you and only you i do cringeworthy shameful things and spill spaghetti out of my pocket way too often shame embarrassment regret and lowself worth run through my body everyday at a great intensity i dont feel any sort of direct sadness lonelines or grief so that probably makes my problems a little different from most others here i often invalidate myself because of this i feel like since every problem is caused by mei am not allowed to treat it like a problem but i am still allowed to validate my feelings this is a rational thought in my head so i guess thats a good start but i cant bring myself to feel it i still feel ashamed embarrassed regretful and of low selfworth all the timedoes anybody have any tips on how to overcome these feelings,suicide

suicide in every way except for actually killing myself yet hey guys this is just a vent type of post so sorry if i come across as annoyingas you may be able to tell from the title i am committing suicide in every way besides actually doing the deed i will not actually kill myself yet as i am still living with my parents i love them to death they are the sole reason i have not hungused an exit bag yet even though i have all of the materialsi am17 male and pathetic i would tell you guys why but its kind of complicated and i think i explained it pretty well in my other posts you could check them out on my profile if youd likebasicallyi ampurposely sabotaging everything i have its a form of self punishmentphysical sabotage i used to workout but ever since i had a mental breakdown about sports and weightlifting i have been eating just enough to survive i do this to lose almost all my muscle mass and athleticism for example used to have 34 standing vertical jump but now it is about 24 by an extreme caloric deficit i am working on becoming severely underweight malnourished and very weak to the point that walking is a chore basically imagine a skeleton with hair i have not been drinking much water either and am trying to stay in a steady state of dehydration again drinking just enough to stay alive i never exercise and force myself for example to take the elevator instead of stairs i know i am extremely lucky and fortunate to have a family that cares and access to all basic necessities but i reject them all i knowi amselfish and uncaring for doing these things but this is how much i hate myself ive even though about getting rid of an arm or leg by making a deep gash into my skin then exposing the gash to infectious diseases this would hopefully cause amputations i still take showers and brush my teeth because i hate being a nuisance to other people by smelling or something otherwise my body is a complete mess rightfully sofinancial sabotage i have a job in lawn care and make about 1250hr which is pretty good for now i am keeping my job for only 2 reasons reason 1 i am saving money to ease the financial troubles my family is going through divorce and both parents have low income reason 2 all the money left over i donate because i dont deserve any of it i feel better when i have no money in my wallet because i know thats what is right for meeducational sabotage i am a pretty good student 465 gpa and 32 act12 act writing thats great and all but this year senior year i am purposely trying to tank my grades i am trying to get all cs or ds so i can barely pass i like to see myself fail tests and assignments even if i know the answers i still choose the wrong ones my grades and act are from freshmanjunior year when i used to be ambitious and attempting to get into university of pennsylvania that dream is gone i do not want to be successful its not worth anything so since i have an all or nothing mindset i am choosing nothingrelationship sabotage this one is probably the least effective on me i dont have many friends but the ones that i do have i am breaking ties with i do things to make them think thati ama very mean and selfish person i sometimes talk back to my teachers to make them think lowly of me as well i still try to do the best for my parents by taking care of them and faking happiness so they can be happy i dont know if its working i dont care they have done so much for me i want to return the favor even if its not sincereso this is it guysi ammethodically ruining my life so suicide isnt that extreme when the time comes i will wait it out until i am as distant as ive ever been to my parents read halfway across the world with minimal contact in order to end it now is not the right time i just wanted to thank you guys so much for reading this far if you have it means a lot to me usually i write better but i have a time limit and i amtyping on the road at each stoplight so there are many breaks in my writing i will see you guys tomorrow no suicide here just eternal suffering ,suicide

ffff id fucking kill myself right now if i hade a private place to do it ohmygod i hate myself so much and i wanna die so bad,suicide
its not that big of a deali amconsidering suicide because i am an absolute failure at life failed academically failed socially failed everything theres nothing in my life worth salvaging i think about my family a lot what it would put them through and that blocks me from doing it committing to it but what harm is it to them really they will be depressed for a little while and then get over it my mother is the onei amworried about the most she is very weak mentally and wouldnt be able to get over it but at the same time she has religion and i think thatd give her strength i hope so at least ive considered writing in my suicide note that i asked for forgiveness for whati amabout to do and i am not a religious person but if asking for forgiveness helps my mother deal with it then id definitely do it my brother and sister would be depressed for a little while but i see them getting through it they are strong my dad would be angry at me and rightfully so but i dont think hed have a hard time getting over it ive thought a lot about losing out on happy experiences and all that but the way i see it its better that someone who is happy and fulfilled in life gets to experience those things instead and i know that those people are out there experiencing those things so its not so bad someone gets to do it it just wont be me i have a noose made and a place i want to go to do it but i dont think its long enough and i amafraid i will botch it theres also a shotgun in the house that i can use but itll be really hard to get access to it since my dad has hidden the key ever since my first attempti amterrified that my family will blame everything and anything and end up getting frustrated and angry at the whole thing but its entirely my own faulti amentirely to blame i want them to blame me but not hate me and i guess thats all i can do,suicide
diy how to survive i have wanted to kill myself for as long as i can remember since i was a kidi am26 now and dont know how to deal with it i have hurt myself in different ways many times over the years but havent made a full out serious attempt to kill myself because no matter how much i want to no matter how much i hate being myself i could not do that to my family i have an amazing family and i know that i am so privileged to say that they know that i have been depressed and support me when i told them thati amtaking antidepressants the treatment helps a lot but even after several months of increased medication i still think about how much i want to kill myself every day i dont know how to deal with it its a bizarre feeling because i know how i want myself to be and its really not hard its just beyond my grasp and i cant make myself be that person no matter how hard ive tried i dont want to try anymore i know i wont try to really kill myself because i truly do love my family that much but i am not sure how to handle these feelings i have already been seeing my doctor and shes a great doctor and knows everything i have told a few close friends about how bad it is and theyre very supportive of helping me get better but i dont know what to do next i just dont want to exist and i wish that there was a way that my loved ones would support it like when you have assisted suicide from a doctor and everyone is okay with it because they know how you are suffering and theres no chance of recovery i have been trying so hard to recover for so long i dont want to do it anymore ,suicide

tell me suicide isnt the answer you cant plain and simple life is worthless we all die every single one of us whats the point of prolonging the inevitable what the hell does it matter if i die now or 50 years from now some of you might say what about how your loved ones would feel if you killed yourself well i will tell you this nobody really cares about anybody else but themselves this isnt coming from a place of angst but of truth human beings only understand the self its all we know as long as we arent 100 certain that the self is all that exists put simply my parents would only be upset because of how they would feel not because of any arbitrary love for me even more simply love is not real it is only a chemical reaction in our brains on top of this every single thing we do in life is just to get a rush of dopamine there is literally nothing else some of you will throw some feel good bullshit at me go ahead try and convince me life is worth living,suicide

i deserve it this past year has been rough i made a lot of friends and lost nearly all of them one after another for reasons ranging from disagreements about politics to someone legitimately trying to manipulate my friends into dumping me because they thought i was making everyone else depressed ever since then that person has been stalking me another person also started stalking me after they decided to end our friendship because i was being too nice to other people and he thought it was fake of me ive lost other friends countless friends throughout the years and these arent the ones that have hurt the most but theyre more in a string of bad endings to friendships that always seem to be my fault so ive been thinking i must deserve it i got up today thinking about ending my life and thats all ive been able to think about all day long my family would get over it my friends would find new friends if they havent already the people who live to torment me will probably be pleased as pie everyone can just go on without me and itll be fine the only thing stopping me right now is cowardice but i amseriously afraid that will eventually run out ,suicide

first suicidal thought in seven months hello last year i suffered a concussion that gave me some awful symptoms including brain fog memory loss decline in social skills extremely uncomfortable feelings in the back of my head and more it was too much to cope with especially after 4 months of going to doctors and not getting any diagnosis i decided killing myself was the only way to escape my seemingly eternal condition i set a date in may and started planning around february i started feeling a little less bad and the doctors also prescribed me some medicine and exercises to get me on the right track so i stopped feeling suicidalat some point during the first four months when i was still trying to figure out what exactly was wrong with me i visited an ent and he prescribed me nose spray which ended up having nothing to do with the problem i started noticing some weird feelings in my nose and ear after taking it for a couple weeks so i stopped the nose feeling never really went away though fast forward about 6 months and i was almost fully healed from the concussion symptoms all of the sudden the nose symptom got a lot worse my entire left nostril felt like the contents had been sucked out of it with a vacuum and now the flow of air is way too strong all of the air flowing in makes both my throat dry and soar all the time and creates this irritating scrapey feeling above my left ear on top of that it seems like some of the brain fog symptoms i was describing earlier have returned along with this thing and i feel like my entire head is a mess againim currently visiting some doctors to see if they can provide any insight but dealing with it for a month and only seeing it get worse is really demoralizing i feel depressed and anxious constantly and kinda feel like i wanna die again idk how longi amgonna be able to hold on this time if my body keeps bombarding me with all of these symptomsjust really needed to vent somewhere thanks for reading,suicide

trying to take the emotion out of it i gave been miserable for awhile now i dont know why but i cant remember the last time i was actually happy despite this i am trying to look at my life logically while removing the emotions from the equation i dont see a path to me being happy i am not that interested in my job it pays well but i dont really enjoy it to be honest i have never had an answer to the question what do you want to do when you grow upi am33 now and i still dont have an answer i dont hate my job but it is just something i do to pay bills the only good thing about my job was this one person i work with long story short i caught feelings for her but she had a boyfriend we became really good friends and she is single now but i am too much of a coward to make a move plus i want her to be happy and i dont think i could make her or anyone happy the hobbies i used to have dont interest me anymore either i used to spend hours and hours playing video games with my brother and friends but about a year ago i completely lost interest in them i try to play them now and i just get bored i also used to be a huge sports fan i would watch football and basketball and pay attention to all the news in the offseason now i could care less i am in a fantasy football league and dont even know what players are on which team anymore i have lost interest in life and am just miserable on most days i recently moved away from my friends and family to try to put some distance between us i want them to get used to the idea of not having me around i would like to be around to see my nephews and niece grow up but when i really think about it they will be better off without me i dont want them looking up to me in anyway and wanting to be like memy plan is to get through this holiday season and then i will probably end i all sometime early next year there are some people at work i want to set up to get promoted that really deserve it in the next couple of months i am also going to be really stingy with my money so i can leave some for my family i plan on buying a one way ticket to a country in europe and ending my life over there i will ditch all my ids and then kill myself my hope is that my body wont be identified and my family can always have hope thati am still alive i dont even really know why i am writing this i guess i am just venting i dont see my life getting any better and i dont have any motivation to go on the way things are i am trying to be logical about this please let me know if there is any fault in my thing,suicide
want to die life isnt worth living dropped out of college due to anxiety stuck at the same job for years nothing is getting better just someone convince me to just fucking end this becausei am too much of a bitch to just do it myself,suicide
just tried killing myself feeling even worse first off i have social anxiety and depression ive never really been very confident around people or by myself for that matter so doing things that seem basic and trivial to most people is always very challenging ive had depression for just over a decade seen several therapists and even tried helping myself by trying to be more active and outgoing but ultimately i will just end up repeating a cycle of being happy for a while and then horribly sad as i start to doubt whether i can truly stay happy that these people around me dont really care about what happens to me that theyre not really hanging out with me because they want to but out of pity that my moods are ruining everyone elses vibe that whether a small mistake i made still gets talked about behind my back that i have no value as a friend or lover or person that when i try to commit suicide i cant even do that becausei am too much of a coward and just feel like dead weighti am so lonely and scared i cant trust people because of a rough childhood growing up in a bad neighbourhood and mostly experiencing betrayal and verbal abuse and its killing me inside i made this throwaway so that maybe at least someone could see this i really dont know what to do anymore,suicide

honestly dont know how to cope with life anymore i honestly never thought id be typing on this subreddit the fact that i am makes me feel even worse i feel guilty because part of me loathes selfpity but i am scared that one of these days i might actually do something really dumb thats whyi amhere this is my first post on this site i literally made an account so i could talk to someone to give a little bit of a backstory because i didnt just wake up like this will probably be helpful i have a history with depression and anxiety i have a history with abuse selfabuse self harm abuse from others ive been romantically involved with and sexual abuse from my childhood now on paper or online that all seems really dark and it is but it doesnt encompass who i am and looking at me youd never be able to telli am an above average attractive 24 year old woman i have very strong metaphysical beliefs and i honestly believe in the good of mankindi amintelligent ive had to fight to get where i am mentally and emotionally to come off as really stable i moved states a year ago to start over and moved to an amazing major city with 400 in my pocket and i made a life for myself here i finally started living a life that i thought i deserved a month ago a girl ive been friends with said to me i honestly dont how youre so stable and inside i chuckled to myself because she like everyone else only sees the surfacei amwhat youd call a functioning depressive to put things in perspective if any of you have ever taken a meyersbriggs personality testi am an enfp robin williams was an enfp my number one goal is for people to not see me suffer because i never want to make anyone sad i hate asking for help i hate telling peoplei amsad to guilt them into wanting to be around me i know its very selfdestructivei ama very selfaware person i was in counseling and also saw a psychiatrist about a year ago because i barely felt like i could keep my head above water i was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 disorder with depression an a general anxiety disorder i scored very high on a dissociation test i would be in the middle of work and kind of black out and forget what i was doing two minutes later ive almost gotten in car accidents because of that as well it makes me seem very spacey and ditzy at times when really i just go somewhere in my head without my permission because its how i learned to cope with trauma as a child my best friend tried to kill herself last december as well shes my roommate and i found her in the bathtub full of blood and had to drive her to the hospital after it had snowed 6 inches the night before december of 16 was my bottom so i started medication to be honest it really fucking helped it got me out of my head enough to focus on my job i got back together with someone who i was very fond of that initially ended because of my instability and things were going great i felt like november december 2016 was my bottom and i fought my way out and got to a stable place then may 17 happened i started to wean back on my medication because i didnt feel like myself anymore i was still in counseling trying to cope with what happened to me in my childhood and deal with that but i didnt feel any emotions i couldnt cry anymore i would be in a room full of people having an amazing time and pretending i felt something so i started to correctly wean off of my meds i had been on them for less than a year and i read how to properly decrease my dose to avoid harsh sideeffects about a month after i completely quit i felt back to me without the ups and downs i could paint again i paint quite frequently and the medication made me not want to do that anymore i could cry and most importantly i could feel things but it got worse i couldnt control my emotions anymore in a responsible way i would lash out at the people i cared about about what i mean 50 of it may have been legitimate things part of subconsiously hating yourself is attracting not so loving people into your life or people who are just as good at suppressing emotions as you are 50 of it was also me lashing out because everything the medication suppressed was and is now at the surface so i ruined a relationship with that guy he wont speak to me anymore which is fine i dont think we were meant to be romantically anyways but i apologized to him a month and a half later for the bad fall out we had and he never said anything i felt really stupid for that and internalized it as something very idiotic that i did i have always tried to escape these issues through relationships i have attachment issues my love language is quality time so i tend to kind of monopolize a new person or a personi amromantically involved with with wanting to spend time with them like all the time part of this is just how i bond part of this is also escaping myself i have recently been involved with a person now for a couple months i dont know if he emphathetically understands these issues not that its his responsibility to fully grasp them but in this situation ive tried to be very selfaware so i dont do those things like lash out etc this person has been of great support to me he has helped pull me out of neutral i have started to find purpose in myself again and a reason for being here today i lashed out at him for something very trivial we are not officially dating because were millenials and its only been a couple months but i love his family they love me i love his dog we spend a majority of our free time together and i find that we really compliment each other in so many ways i truly adore him of course there is a catch when i met this person he told me that he might be going to europe for an extended period of time in the fall so thats part of the reason we to keep it casual but it just ended up getting more serious and eventually his me statements became we statements i sometimes feel with this person i am on a rollercoaster once we started to get more serious he kind of pulled back to make sure he was making all the right decisions regarding his emotions and my emotions i respected that but with all of my relationship insecurities i saw it as a big red flag that hes just going to dip out come time hes reassured me that he could never rid me of his life but maybe that isnt good enoughi am looking for something to give me purpose so i dont kill myself one dayi am looking for it in the wrong places and the wrong people and i amaware of that but old habits die really hard its like watching a character on a movie screen make all of these mistakes and from the theater youre yelling stop doing that but they just keep doing it over and over again part of me thinks i should cut things off to save him from me to save myself the inevitable heart break i will no doubt feel when he decides to leave for europe without me part of me knows i lash out because yeah i am insecure as f about where the relationship is going but also because i have deep seated emotional fears i fear that i will be forgotten i fear that i will drive everyone away from me i fear that even when there is a light at the end of the tunnel my destructive patterns will not let me see it because the dark and malicious part of my personality wants me to feel absolute misery it has convinced me that is a safe and inevitable state of mind believe me when i say if you met me youd think i was the queen of positivity i want everyone to experience love and to feel loved for some reason i wont allow that for myself and it kills me suicide at this point albeit fucking terrifying for so many reasons seems less and less terrifying each and every day the first time the thought crossed my mind i was freaked out now its where my mind jumps to the peace that i would feel even for a millisecond of not having to upset anyone anymore i have a very loving and supportive family but they dont know any of this my best friend is doing great now from her dark time back in december and i feel like if i bring anything up its going to remind her of that and send her into a relapse i bottle all of this up i even asked the guy thati amseeing to see him because i felt scared to be alone because of my thoughts but he said that he thinks its best if we both have space tonight because of how i lashed out at him earlier so nowi amembarrassed i feel guilty for even bringing that up to him i feel like he doesnt care does anyone i guess whati am looking for is for a reason not to do it eventuallyi amopen to anything really i wouldnt be here posting this if i didnt feel so low maybe someone can also direct me to a subreddit with supportive females or supportive people with experience with childhood sexual abuse trauma i internalize everything everything ends up being my fault even when it isnt and its a vicious cyclei amjust hoping that before i choose to like literally end my life i keep going on the off chance that something good will happen howi am not seeing that i dont get it but i just dont at the moment ,suicide

told everyone i want to die still want to die it just came spilling out of me one night when talking to my mom then i stumbled into telling an empathetic acquaintance when i asked her for advice on something over drinks a few days later during an anxiety attack a friend messaged me and i impulsively told her that ive been suicidal for the past year and that i was having a mental breakdown and nowi amtelling you internet strangerim not sure what i expected to get out of telling people i guess i was looking for some reason to live to just hit me but it hasnt now i just feel more trapped than ever if i kill myself nowi am going to cause any immense amount of pain and guilt my death wouldnt have been painless for my parents anyway which is why ive forced myself to live for so long but now i would be a complete fucking asshole for killing myself after i told them i think the problem is that i now feel obligated to improve and i dont know how to do that ive been seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist for a year now changed therapists 3 times now insurance issues long story the drugs dont work though and as for the therapy the simple fact is that you cant decide for someone that their life is worth living i have been suicidal many times over my life but they were at emotional crisis points when i hated myself i dont necessarily hate myself now i just havent thought life was worth living for a year now and i still dont food is unappetizing nothing is funny anymore i dont get joy from anything all that remains is an obligation to others thats all i have left ,suicide
i wanna kill myself so desperately i am absolutely tired of this loneliness this lack of human connection and compassion the fact that i am unlikable and cant talk to people i dont see any future for me i dont see how i can survive the adult world as i am not a competitive person and my social skills are down the drain i cant do anything right success and love of any type just seem like they werent meant for me i wanna die sooo bad but i dont wanna hurt my family i am waiting till the latter half of my 20s to commit suicide i am 20 so maybe i can give life a chance but i cant wait till then for now i will just hope something kills me i dont know how much longer i can take this i am sooo 110 fucking done ,suicide

i dont know how to open upi ama 19 year old college student and ive had this problem for my entire life i dont know how to be open about how i feel i was bullied and neglected by my friends throughout high school and middle school and i feel like this and past painful experiences have made me too afraid to tell people wheni amupset or how i feel about things in general my college friends have been nice to me but i feel likei amstarting to be neglected by them too because i constantly feel likei ambeing left out of their conversations and when we hang out they hardly talk to me i always come up with witty jokes to make them laugh and they often tell me how talented i am but i feel likei amjust an entertainer to them rather than a friend i want to be able to have real conversations with them and tell them how i feel but they always ignore me and drown me out i have aspergers which makes this especially difficult because sometimes they get impatient with how slow i am to say things and also it sometimes doesnt come out quite right and they dont fully understand whati am trying to say when i do manage to get something out just being around them feels so degrading if i talk about wanting to kill myself or being depressed they thinki amjust joking so they think nothing of it and carry on talking to each other when we get drunk together is the only time i have enough courage to say how i feel but i am still drowned out if i had access to more alcohol id probably have a serious drinking problem because the only time i feel released from the pressure of social anxiety stress and negative thoughts is wheni amdrunki amunable to ease my depression from crying because i feel likei amno longer physically able to its the worst feeling being trapped inside your own mindmaybe i dont give them enough to work with to deserve their care or respect i sometimes feel like i dont give them enough of my attention to deserve theirs i think of committing suicide all the time but ive never gotten enough courage to try it but i feel like i wont be able to live like this for much longer because i will soon have to face this while dealing with trying to find a decent job and facing the world,suicide

no safety thank you for reading i feel like i have no one that understands or gets it ive always been extremely anxious ever since i was around 5 years old and i have been depressed since about 11 years old ive had recurring suicidal thoughts since about 13 i am now 24 and i wasnt diagnosed with chronic major depression until a couple of years ago ive had my first attempt last year i had a very intense fight with my mom she was listening in on me telling my boss that i need a break from work because of my mental health problems my goal was to end my life after that fight but i still dont believe it was an attempt i cant wrap my head around the fact i did attempt suicide because nothing happened i didnt end up unconscious or anything from the half of bottle of pills that i took i could hear my mom saying she wanted to kill herself and my dad telling her to put down the knife i snapped out of whatever mental break i had when i took the pills and i told my dad what i did he drove me to the hospital afterward i was treated evaluated and was voluntarily committed to another mental hospital for 2 weeks the treatment i received worked for some time but my depression came back around june my suicidal thoughts started in july and i have been cutting again to cope my family isnt exactly supportive i have an older brother who has problems too but he is basically verbally abusive towards my mom and i he will call me anal whore slut and use christianity to put me down hes not even a christian i am not comfortable dating or having relationships so i dont at all he constantly brings up the one and only guy i went out with a few years ago to tell mei amforever his bitch he would text me offensive and creepy things before i started forwarding his texts to the rest of my family they wont do anything he is literally a troll he will constantly say the exboyfriends name or call me a bitch if my parents arent around he would make kissing noises and faces at me if i was around or drive by him he has said unprovoked that i should kill myself after i was out of the hospital he cant keep any job and lacks any kind of common sense or respect he will act like a crazy jerk in our house but he will quickly act normal if he is outside of our neighborhood my dad tells me to ignore him but how do you ignore something like that he wont bother or threaten my father or other brothers he is about 6 and my mom and i are under 52 he has smacked my mom in the face before and i have gotten into physical altercations with him as well my dad is usually there to stop them but he doesnt have much authority ever since the police told my father the owner of the house can kick my brother out hes stopped caring because its my mothers responsibility they keep allowing him to come back i dont feel safe in my house or in my neighborhood anymore the boy and i use to ignore each other if we ever cross paths but he now makes it a point to harass me even outside i am constantly looking over my shoulder he has even attempted to walk in the middle of the road if he sees me driving down the street and he will do something obnoxious when i drive by him anyway my mom will constantly say hes not normal but she allows him to continue living here she owns the house and i cant stand her enabling him my brother is aware of this and he has recently started shouting at my mom no power i literally have nowhere else to go and i dont have a car i feel trapped i have a moderate to severe autoimmune disease and it can prevent me from going to work or school i feel like between my depression disease shame and crappy family that i would be better off dead if he went away life wont be as depressing and i can effectively deal with my other personal issues more often i was already depressed before he started becoming a monster but it feels like there is no safe place to recover with him lurking in the house sorry for the long post thank you again for reading,suicide

sucidal thoughts i m 20 i currently work in retail after leaving a web development job which i didn t enjoy so i left after a week it gave me depression feeling like a guinea pig i ve been dating my girlfriend for 8 months now she s 18 and i ve been living at her parents house since we dated my mum has a two bedroom flat but she keeps meeting random guys and sometimes i hear them having sex and it gets to me she s a single mum as my dad left me at child birth we don t really get on and talk rarely my girlfriend is now going to university left today and i ve depended on her so much for happiness that i don t know how to be happy without her we ve talked about the future to the point of me engaging her in a few years time i m moving by chance to a new job opportunity 20 minutes away from her but will only be on the odd occasion be able to see her on the weekends and i can t cope with the idea of that i trust her but i depend on her and i fall down the ditch of suicidal tendencies when i m alone i ve researched what i can do and where i can get the equipment i ve not discussed this with her because i m not here to blackmail someone into submission that s both selfish and weak on my behalf i worry that no job will satisfy me and i m in an endless loop that ll make me unhappy i m not happy with that amount of time i ll be able to see her compared to other people and i just can t live happily with myself as i feel like i ve been born to die i never seem content with what i have and i can t cope alone and alone is exactly what i m going to be is it really so bad just for me to call it quits i ll break her heart but i feel like there s no other way and that this is the end i can hand on heart tell you now that if she broke up with me that i would 100 end it i m not waiting for that eventuallity because i know she isn t the type but i feel like i need to do this for me people are born for every statistic to be killers and everything else and i feel that because of how my life has affected me that only death can set me free but i always think this way when i m down but maybe this is the bullet that ll get me out i m just not sure what to do and everything seems to lead to my unhappiness and abandonment issues to get the end of me edit we have spoken about how i am as i lost the will to live when she went away on a holiday it s not jealousy it s just me not being ok with myself i tell her i don t want to talk to her about my problems all the time because that pushes people away even if they say it doesn t,suicide

nothing changes i used to be a drug addict and dealer i hated my life and everyday i hope i would find the drive to kill myself or overdose one day i thought it was my rock bottom nowi am sober and somehow managed to get to a job the pays extremely well but i still want to die more now than back then every single day for most of the day i think about it i look at myself in the mirror and i want to put a bullet through that persons headi amscum and i dont deserve life love happiness friends and family i cant keep on like this for much longer i already have for far too long,suicide
how to stay happy i have posted on here several times before each time i have been talked out of killing myself however i am tired of being talked out of it i want to either stop being miserable or just die i recently quit my job at mcdonalds because it was making me more suicidal than ever and have been going to college i am scared of my horrible grades as i think i may go on academic probation after that i will have large student loans pilled up on my head no job and no way to ever get a job that isnt a dead end job that makes me want to kill myself therefore i have decided if i go on probation i will kill myself i have gotten obsessed with the idea of death lately i think about what death would be like and ways i could quickly die about 70 of the day what is bothersome to me is that other people who have the same situation or even worse situations are able to stay happy this is frustrating to me not because these people are happy but because i feel like i am completely missing something that these people are is it genetic is it a mindset if it is either how could we ever change our mindsets or genetics after all we are who we aretldr i am extraordinarily unhappy because of many situations and am likely going to kill myself at the end of the semester unless i can find a way to stay happy i am tired of being talked out of it this is a final decision instead i want advice to be happy,suicide
i think ive realized what hurts the most about all of this and thats that i didnt even get a choice i was born with this difference disorder i willness whatever you want to call it i didnt get to choose to be normal and even if i had started the treatment options earlier my body and mental health would have always been fucked i cant stand being trans if i wake up tommorow still feeling dysphoria i might really end it ,suicide

cant live with or without her we had a falling out because of drama and nowi am not going back to her because of various reasons it hurts a lot to talk to her but after 2 years of friendship i dont think i can stand being without her anyway she is a bit toxic but i was going through a really bad time when she came to my life when i was alone almost all the time and she was the first person i actually spoke to in a while i dont know how to put the past 2 yrs of friendship in words because she really means a lot to me even though she was a pain to talk to at the same timei ampretty conflicted because i feel like i would do better if i cut her out of my life but at the same time i feel like i lost something really important that i will never get back again and it feels like it because in comparison to her everyone else seems awful they dont even want to try to be similar to her at 20 i have been seriously considering suicide because everything seems really awful and painful without her in my life i wont get her back so whats the pointi always think about how the scenario could have been different but it just makes it worse,suicide

end of my rope i lost my dream job in 2009 i havent been the same since ever since then things have been going downhill my wife and i stopped being intimate we basically existed and somehow continue to exist as roommates she makes more money than i do now and she takes care of 90 of the household expenses the small amount of money i do bring in goes towards my debts i have been unable to get past the job list 8 years ago i dont know why but i just cannot do it adding to that my health has gotten worse since then i refuse to go to the doctor and refuse to go to the dentist i just cant bring myself to do it instead i drink myself into a stupor nearly every night and ignore the pain in my mouth and in my chest i am now at the point where if i dont get over my reluctance to take care of myself i wont be able to get a meaningful job or make anything out of myself problem is i am so terrified of learning that something horrible is going on that i cant see past that it occupies my every thought my wife is an incredible woman she accepts my faults most of them and is incredibly patient i am failing her i have failed her in the past and if i am around for more years i will continue to fail her and fail myself i can no longer accept this i just turned 40 i dont want to turn 41 on my 40th birthday spending time with my parents and wife i looked out over the city and decided that tuesday was the day that i needed to let them all move on now it is friday and i dont feel any different family have gone home wife has a bright future i feel like i am just a roadblock to prosperity i remember when i was 19 and i was convinced that i would die before i was 21 i lived a hard life and made some bad choices back then in fact i should have died a number of times somehow i survived and prospered then things went off the rails again i guess this is what happens and at the end of the day i think tuesday was always the logical conclusion ,suicide

freshers week at university is killing me absolutely killing me for those who dont know freshers week is the first week or two weeks at university here in the uk lots of parties and events take place during the week or weeks and lots of people end up meeting each other or forming relationships i wish i could say that i either hate or love it but i cant give a solid answer on the one hand meeting lots of new people and going to clubs and getting drunk for the first time in my life feels good and takes away most of my sorrows and defensiveness but on the other hand things get much much worse when i realise what is really going on in those events and how much of a failure i amthere are lots of issues that i have so far but one of the main ones is you guessed it virginity and girls many websites and newspapers claim that one of the big things that will happen during freshers week is the romance or getting with someone whether its a simple dance making out or actually bringing them back for a one night stand many students have done something with either the opposite or the same sex sometimes both during this week or weeks and thats one of the main causes of awkward situations when you meet that someone you did it withi hate it i hate being a virgin even as young as 18 i hate seeing all these girls and boys whether they are already in a relationship or just met making out with each other or even kissing once or twice i hate having to make things awkward when i talk to girls or things not going further than just a short conversation though i fully respect consent and if they simply dont want to go any further i hate having to constantly be on the defensive in case they have a boyfriend or guy with them who will attack anyone who so much as talks to them in a wrong way i hate having to end up losing my friends to the crowd in the centre of the club which i learned the hard way i dont survive in i hate so much more of what goes on therebut i cant leave iti cant leave it because i know i will achieve nothing of the sorts should i try and seek out ways other than going to a nightclubi am not looking for a girlfriend at the moment its freshers week for fucks sake youre not meant to be forming relationships already because they wont last and please dont emphasise on this point its trivial every single night every single minute of me being in there not being able to do what the other guys who got girls are doing is torture its the worst i have ever felt in my five years of wanting to get a girl possibly the worst in my life me being suicidal at 11 was nothing compared to what i am and will be going through at the moment i am at a complete loss its the end of the first of two weeks of freshers and i still havent made any progress ive got drunk three times out of the five times i went out and still no drunken making out or hooking up though i know there are other ways to get with girls every time i ask someone for help they are on repeat here are a few examples of what they say and what i really really want to replyyou dont need to rush things b neither did the guys making out with the girlsi am not rushing things because i want toi amrushing things because i have to because if i dont do so by the end of freshers things will get a lot harder as i will have to balance lectures and activities with trying to get with a girl life is more than just losing your virginitymaking out with a girl i know that and just so people know i know its not going to fuck with my studies in any way i wont let it people have said that so many fucking times its not helping either offer some real advise or dont the same can be said of a lot of things yet people still worry about themthere are lots of people who are still virginsdidnt make out with a girl still not helping its the same as saying to a depressed person lots of people suffer from depression at some point in their lives its a subtle way of saying get over it which in itself is really not a helpful thing to sayyoull end up with a lot of embarrassmentawkward situations no hell to the no the same people saying to those who got drunk and embarrassed themselves its alright b they wont even remember it when lectures start have the audacity to say this to me there is nothing embarrassing or awkward about being able to say i lost my virginity during freshers week and it was great or i made out with her so hard last night if anything it will instil confidence nobody fucking understands nobody like drones all they do is just repeat the same fucking useless advicei am at my wits end with this it runs through my mind every fucking minute of the dayi am not trying to set up a multinational company become a multi millionaire or anything that i know will take time and effort alli am looking to do is make out with a girl like all the other guys seem to effortlessly do and end up taking one back to my place to fuck is that so much to fucking ask for ,suicide

my 17f best friend 18m is depressed and suicidal and its draining me its going to be longi am sorry about that so a little background weve been friends for about 4 years with its ups and downs but in the end we still stick together he has had a lot of problems in his life living in a poor family sexual and verbal abuse from colleagues and death of his father to name the most important onesrecently his girlfriend broke up with him to be with another guy from his class obviously he now hates that guy hes had undocumented but pretty much obvious depression and suicidal thoughts before that but i think this has been a breaking point for himafter the breakup hes been telling me a lot more than usual about how he feels saying that hes never going to find anybody who will love him romantically that hes given up on talking to new people because everyone who he meets ends up breaking his heart in some way that he feels alone and basically lacks reason to live plus is overdrien with hatred for that guyno matter how many times i try telling him that its not true that he has people me and some other friends who care about him he doesnt listen to me and just keeps talking about all of this there has even been instances where he would outwardly tell me his plans on killing himself and i had to talk him out of it he would also mention the guy that stole his girlfriend a lot talk about how much he hates him describe how he wants to attackkill him even mention that hes had a dream where he shots him with pleasure they go to the same schoolclass so he even stopped attending it because he says he cant stand looking at him and seeing how happy he isnow the reasoni amwriting all of this is because ive tried helping him a lot of times but theres only so much that i can do i told him that he should see a therapist but he doesnt want to i try telling him that its going to be okay and that i will stay with him but he doesnt believe it hes questioned me a few times thinking that i dont actually care about him but i am still working on proving him otherwise and i think its slowly succeeding but i will be honest and say that its really draining me the way he talks about all of his problems and i cant even help him in any way every single time he starts talking about this i feel guilty for not being able to do anything usefuli amstarting to question this friendship because i love and care about him a lot not in a romantic way but the amount of sadness that i get from knowing how he feels just makes me want to stop talking to him sometimesi realize its probably selfish of me to say this but really talking to him when hes like this has been very tiring i feel like i cant do anything to help him anyway after all ive tried so i just end up reading about how he gives himself max 5 years of life because he says that after that he probably wont have the strenght to live anymore and how he puts on a mask and pretends to be happy it feels like its too much for me but maybei amjust the wrong one because hes clearly sick and in a worse situation than me so i wanted to know am i wrong for being tired of it should i still be friends with him if it brings me so much pain i cant just leave him now because he would get even more depressed and suicidal so what should i dohe truly believes that theres no way he could ever feel better or find someone that will love him he refuses to see a therapist because after his fathers death he doesnt want to give his mother any more reasons to worry i dont know what to do anymore thank you for any help by the way i am not a native english speaker so id like to apologize if the text is chaotic or if there are any grammatical errorstldr my best friend is depressed and suicidal doesnt want to get help i love him but its physically and mentally draining me and i dont know what should i do,suicide
is this normal heythese days ive been feeling down at school i barely talk with friends also since we are in different classes i laugh at jokes but as soon as i am alone i start to think of how i get hurt example when i stand at the bus stop i imagine how i would jump infront of a car and get hit there is something holding me back and i am probably too scared to do it anyway in the last hours i started to push myself to do impulses things like throwing my phone i am signed up to do workout but i am not feeling like it i lied to my parents that i went to the gym even though i didnt and now they dont talk to me and say what an asshole i am granted i am rude to my parents sometimes and now they keep talking what an unthankful asshole i am these things might be right but it brings me to another point i get angry pretty quickly lately its not that i have some uncontrolled aggression disorder idk the point is i imagine myself being hit and being in a comaunconscious but am too scared to be permanently dead ive been thinking about going to a psychiatrist but maybe this is something everyone goes through sorry if this is all ordered its just that i dont know anymore activities like programming or gamings arent enjoyable anymore to me,suicide

i like to think i feel normal but theni am not killing myself goes through my mind a lot i used to think it was normal and that everyone has these thoughts and theres nothing to worry about its been getting more and more frequent of coming to mind for the past couple months it feels like there has not been one day that goes by without the thought of ending myself it scares me because i feeli ambecoming more accepting andor prone to do iti ambecoming less afraid to die today i got hit the scariest rush of just wanting to do it it had never felt so strong in my life beforei amscared that its going to get worse,suicide
i think this is it i just finished my note to my husbandim scared to die but i see no other solution i am pathetic and my life is a mess i feel ashamed for being me i have noone except husband and he would be so much better without me i cant get help noone can help me and i can no longer help myself for 20 years i have hanged in there hoping for life to be better and yes some days life felt livable but this last year my life has come crumbeling down on me and the only solution is to end it it would be so muchbetter for my husband in the long run my depth will die with me my pathetic beeing will be gone all my life i heard how strong i am but i am not i am fucking weak i have nothing even my parents could not live for me so why should i yes both my parents commited suicide so did my uncle three other friends and my best friend and then i brought all this problems on myself by being a useless piece of shiti am so sick now i cant work or anything i hardly ever sleep or eat my life is hopeless and i bring nothing good to the table just being alive is not enoughi wish i could live but i cant i see no light in the tunnel i feel shameful for bringing myself to all this depth and now when i cant work everything comes tumbeling down on me i hate myself i hate to feel this way i am not strong i am weak as hell ,suicide
so i kinda went to look at guns today soi amprobably going to be fired next week because my work has been garbage this is just the cherry on top of a lot of garbage making me think continuing to deal with depression and severe anxiety like i have been for the past five years and my entire life basically nowi ambusting my ass to try and make sure i dont lose the job but i kinda hate it anyways and this is the second time this has happened where i am really close to being fired i guess i kinda came out of it while at the army navy store but goddamn like i was at that point like you read where suicidal folks get happy thinking they are finally at that point where its gonna end i guess part of it was deciding i didnt have enough experience with guns and needed to research it more or practice with one before i know itll be lethal like its still a very real possibility of happening me buying one my state has no waiting period and i have enough money at the moment to buy onei am not sure what i thought id get out of posting this i guess i needed to venti am trying to schedule an appointment with my therapist for tomorrow or monday but fucking hell ,suicide
i did a mistake ok so today at work a few co workers brought up suicide and joked about it a bit and i was in but then i started to casually explain the best ways to kill oneself and how i would do iti am21 and i have a very detailed plan for killing myself wheni am30 and life doesnt change to the better and one of them said seems like you thought about that a lot and i didnt know what to say and just went silent everyone looked at me in a weird way and i awkwardly tried to change the topicpretty scared that theyll tell this to our boss or other coworkersany of you ever had a slip up like that,suicide
it would not matter if i died 10 months ago i had some good times indeed but the times when i was at peace were very rare and i think i would not be missing out on anything had i died the thought of unconsciousness and void is still alluring it actually made me welcoming of death and not scared of it i already have an idea how to end it though had quite some time to think about that i dont want this its that simple,suicide
i thinki amdone i basically mauled my academic career in about 3 days and dont have the energy to put that or myself back together ive fallen apart so many times already and dying just sounds nice tbh,suicide
everything i do leads to suicide delete,suicide
i dont know what to say really i guess i just want to get this off my chest and see if someone can give me a reason to go on this post might sound like bullshit or exaggerated but its all true i dont think theres any way i could prove this stuff thoughi was born with aspergers ocd and depression ive wanted to die for one reason or another every day of my life as far back as i can remember i almost attempted suicide when i was sixmy family hates me both of my sisters would routinely bully me to the point of me wanting to die when i used to live at home my mom and dad like to treat my problems as a joke and laugh at me for being retarded or too much of a little bitch to get laid i would be physically abused chocked beaten head slammed into a wall and had my problems laughed at i remember being so sick i could barely stand and being told to stop ruining their nature walk i was also molested by a neighbor i told my parents they either didnt believe me or didnt care and hes been over to our house many times for holidays events or dinners ever sincethe only thing i ever really enjoyed was video games but my mom refused to even consider letting me have any even if i bought them with my own money no less she said i needed to spend all my time studying so i could get scholarships to college and i was ten when this started congrats to me i got a bunch of scholarships to a college i didnt want to go to and now spend my days in college year five so busy i barely have time to do anything besides study and its all for a degree for a job that i hate so much i would rather die than have to do every dayi have almost no friends and the few i do are usually too busy to ever talk to me i usually talk to them once a week at besti have no money no social life no romantic interesti am an asexual sex disgusts me and so does romance barely any friends and a family that hates me i can look forward to a life of working a job i dont want to work until i get old enough to retire retiring to an empty house with no friends or family and then slowly watching myself get old and then die with no one around who loves or even cares about me ,suicide
had my first thought today i havent been diagnosed but i amprobably depressed my emotions mostly feel like trying to see through waxpaper but lately ive been seesawing very badly i whiplashed today and almost quit my gym workout i got a wave of self consciousness and defeatism before i left my house pissed off at my appearance not being what i want it to be and having no control or recourse not obesity or anything but just genetic traits i get angry i cant achieve the appearance i want without a ton of effort i cant imagine how it is for women to feel something like that daily i will certainly never downplay their self consciousness ever i think i have a narcissistic streak that kicks in as a defense mechanism from accepting thati ama total failure piece of trash i know that i am not but facts dont matter when feelings are involved as soon as i got out of the shower after work i looked at myself trudged through my routine and felt totally drowned in hopelessnessthen i felt physically nauseous weak and had a suicidal thought on a treadmill i have no idea what happened but i finished my workout and i seem to be ok now i had a couple friends from years ago show up as they do regularly so i sort of had to snap out of it for some reason i wanted to explore the idea i visualized doing it with a gun in my room i wont go into the details not just because the rules say not to but i wasnt really interested in the effect on me for some reason my mind was immediately picturing my parents hearing a loud bang and feeling their gut drop through the floor at the suspicion of what i did then rushing over to finally see it it was less a taunt for me to do it but something my mind wouldnt let me get away with without going all the way it was a morbid curiosity that spawned from an intense wave of raw self loathing its so odd because i was generally 30 minutes before this happenedi think i just cant accept that i wont be what i see in my mind i dont get the attention i feel i deserve i ignored and i dont know what to do my life feels incomplete i dont know how to get to stage 2i amsurviving but i am not living and dont feel in control enough to adequately improve my life but i should be in controli am an adulti ama who is trying to be in the top 10 i look in the mirror and see 2 people depending on my mood balance i see a somewhat handsome man ready to take on the world and other times a man who is deluded afraid and hiding and the world by not giving me any attention is feeding the latter self image,suicide

why i have depression and what it makes me feel likei am26 years old i will be 27 in october ive suffered with depression for most of my teenage years and all the way up to now i will have it for the rest of my life its not something that can be cured only managed with a daily dose of medication that some days doesnt feel like it works i was bullied all throughout secondary school from roughly the ages of 12 to 16 it was an unpleasant time in my life there were a few people i hung around with and spoke to but i still felt like i had no friends within school my best friend went to a different school he was the only real friend i had outside of it i saw him nearly every day but i still felt like an outsider within my group of friends and even my own family i felt alone during school i was called names slammed into lockers tackled to the floor and pinned down i even had a brick thrown at my head once by one of my oldest friends the sad part is even though i was angry and hurt by what happened i couldnt bring myself to walk away from them because i didnt want to be alone i wasnt very smart i did poorly in my gcses after leaving school i took an ict course in college because i had aspirations to become a video game developer but i dropped out after a month because i knew it would take more than an active imagination to become a developer it would take brains and i was severely lacking in that departmentso after dropping out i ended up living at home jobless playing my xbox all day and doing very little else id borrow money that i had no intention of paying back off my parents and grandparents i feel guilty about that honestly i was always quite lazy i never really wanted to work but a part of that came from lack of confidence and rejection because i was bullied in school i had very little confidence in myself i was always doubting myselfi am not smarti am not goodlooking i will never amount to anything and i didnt like being rejected it made me feel worthless especially when i went to interviews and they said you dont have much experience do you my reaction was always how am i supposed to get experience if no one will hire me no one seemed to understand that i had a few small jobs that lasted a few days each but i always ended up being a jobless bum then one day my grandad got me a job with him growing christmas trees best job i ever had i loved it i worked there for maybe two years i enjoyed the work the money was great but it was only a temp job and i knew that going inone day my grandad asked me to drive the tractor up and down the yard whilst our boss was on holiday so i could get used to it he wanted me to reverse it back up the yard i did and almost crashed into the shed he lost his temper and yelled at me basically called me useless i felt so low that i sat in the truck for the rest of day and cried he was right i am useless in november 2015 i met my exfiancee amy she was my first girlfriend because i never had the confidence to approach a girl and ask her out i was a virgin until i was 24 i felt so special when amy agreed to go out with me i felt even more special when she said yes to marrying me two months later life was great for a long time then in march 2016 my job growing christmas trees came to an end and i was so scared that i wouldnt find another luckily amy helped me and i had a cleaning job within the week life was great againand then something happened i finally admitted that i had depression and thats when things went wrong i started taking antidepressants but i foolishly stopped taking them because i felt like i was getting better and thats when i started treating amy poorly i was nasty to her i hit her eventually i lost my cleaning job and life went extremely downhill from that point onwards i became more nasty and cruel i was snapping at her more often i hit her more often she didnt know who shed get next jekyll or hyde jekyll was the man she fell in love with sweet kind caring loving the man who helped her get out of debt that her exboyfriend left her in a week after we met the man who bought her an xbox one as her first christmas present the man who treat her like the princess she was hyde was the man she scared of cruel physically abusive nasty a man who didnt realise what he was doing until it was too late who didnt care about the damage he was causing in short he was an asshole but that wasnt the real me the real me was the man who would hold her as she cried herself to sleep who would sit on the sofa crying after trying to follow her when her mum upset her only to be told to leave her alone who made her laugh at his stupid jokes who would help her with money whenever she needed it in short he was the man she fell for two months ago she left because shed had enough of the abuse and i cant really blame her for thati am angry at myself for letting it get this far and for being such a stubborn idiot i never meant to hurt her i never meant to cause her so much painnowi amalone againi amjobless again because i quit and i am in so much pain myself becausei ammy own worst enemy all i ever wanted was to get married have a family i can be proud of and have a job i like so i can provide for them i wanted a son who grows up to be a better man than his father and a daughter who grows up to be exactly like her mother i have friends and family who say they care about me but i am not entirely convinced they do if they did my three best friends would have invited me to visit new york next year if they did my family would invite me around for a meal one night the little things maybe i dont want them to care so it would be easier for me to do what i feel i have to do in order to make this pain go away ive tried to commit suicide three times in the past two months i tried to overdose three times and failed each time ive cut myself too during those times i tried to kill myself i was acting irrationally because she refused to talk to me after a month of no contact she decided to contact me out of the blue and brought all these old feelings back then she decided to ignore me making me feel a hundred times worse because now i knew that she had been with other people since our breakup and she was out with her friends whilst i was crying in my room so i was trying to kill myself because i was upset over being ignored and being let down by her but now i feel that if i do commit suicide itll be spontaneous therell be no plan itll just happen i can already feel something or someone pushing me towards the edge i know howi am going to do it but it wont be me doing it i wont be in control and maybe thats exactly how i want it to be i love my family i love my friends i love amy i dont want to die i want to live theres so much i want to do i want to play the next splinter cell and watch john wick 3 but not when i feel likei am in hell i feel numb lost adrift in an ocean of despair and loneliness a man so broken by the events of his life that hell never be whole again and i want so desperately to make us both whole again but as much as i dont want to admit it i believe that ship has sailed and its never coming back depression kills everything your mind body soul heart family friends love and hope its the hardest thing to endure because only you can endure it people can try to help you through it but they cant share the weight by carrying your burden with you only you can and thats what makes you feel alone because youre the only person who understands exactly what it is youre going through its hard to listen to people telling you to stay strong when you have no reason to stay strong its those people who make you feel weak its those people taking your hope away from you by the things they say or do my own mother and sister have called me selfish for wasting everyones time when theyre trying to help me it pisses me off that my mum has called me selfish when she suffers from depression too and has wanted to do it herself but the only reason she hasnt is because of me and my sister in all fairness thats a perfectly good fucking reason to not do it if i had kids i wouldnt do it because i have a responsibility to them but because i have no kids no job no partner ive got not responsibilities so why shouldnt i be allowed to end iti saw someone say on another reddit page that its only selfish in the sense that i want something for myself and that its the type of selfishness that someone should be allowed to have which to me is completely spot on whats truly selfish is wanting someone to live in misery and permanent suffering just so you dont feel sad or upset over their passing it takes true courage to make that jump knowing full well that youll never go to the cinema again eat your favourite food again or make love again the only thing that stops us from doing it is the knowledge of the void well be leaving behind but unfortunately it will get to a stage where we cant quite comprehend that thats the danger of mental i willness it blinds us to the world around us in our heads were totally alone which means theres no one to hurt ive come to understands that life is a series of events that leads us down a path of darkness with occasional beams of light i willuminating the way forward its not the destination that matters its how you get there and who you get there with unfortunately the person i wanted to get there with is no longer around,suicide
it got so much better and nowi am in hell again i dont even know how to begin about nine months ago i first posted here i was in hell like ive been for most of my life then at the beginning of the year i decided to risk it all i told my best friend i always loved him we got together i felt like he gave me a purpose and made me felt alive he showed me the path to get out of hell i couldnt believe it in fact i lost it all after a couple months he broke up with me out of the blue via message and blocked me i have been on meds ever since part of me wants to destroy him or what he has become as hes not who i knew but rather a stranger part of me wants to destroy myself because i thought it could get better i could be happy its all gone in the blink of an eye i just have no reason to be here life is not fair i am so tired of fighting and for what i gave him everything and all i got as a thank you was to be treated worse than shit everything ive done with him was the bright side in my life i have never been happier now everything just lost meaning i feel like a robot living becausei amsupposed to not killing myself because of the pain i would cause to my family sometimes i wish my life was really my own and that i could just end it ,suicide

hey i have been thinking about suicide for the past few days hi my story is rather simple i am 24 years old and have always been unlucky and failure i have also been used as a laughing stock many times in my group of friends that is the purpose i have served i am not sure that i want to continue is this is all that life has to offer me few months ago i went to travel with my friends not a big trip just a one day trip and i kept being subject of all the jokes it felt like i was being harassed or bullied i feel like this is not meant to be happening now i mean we are in 20s we are not in 8th grade anymore but it happened and it felt terriblethis is one of the event but i have always been an outcast all my life always been laughed at i have embarassed myself people have ridiculed me it has been an embarrassing life i just feel like i cant do it anymorei love my parents and they have showered me with love all my life so i feel tornalso i have bipolar disorder have failed two colleges used to be an engineering major but now doing some easy arts courses in a shitty college just to get a degree i am about to graduate in like 89 months but my degree is embarrassing i have terrible score and i am not getting employed either after graduation and quite funnily i dont know whether i am even functional enough to workgood thing about my life is that i was born in a fairly wealthy family so i am not worried about poverty or anythingalso in few years i would be arranged married and i just hate the idea of it i mean what if i just completely hate the person what if the person hates me it is basically marrying a stranger and the people i have met in my current college i just cant get along with them at all what if she is one of such personalso i am supposed to not tell them about my i willness but it will eventually come out and sometimes people even want a divorce when they realize they have been lied to in arranged marriages it is the number one reason for divorce in india i read in an article but on the other hand if i tell them that i have mental i willness they will interpret it as me saying i am crazy i am lunatic and they will cancel it and not give me a chance so i would feel like i am duping someone into somethingit is just a terrible feeling of not experiencing and exploring what love is but just marrying a stranger it will just be something that happens in tvi spend like 78 hours easily on the internet feeling guilty about it feeling like i am just wasting my life have not been able to study since 21 days just not been able to motivate myself to sit and open a book and study have tried but just not been able to do itnow i dont know if i want to continue living this life of hermit no friends no love no work terrible education mental i willness,suicide
i guessi am not on the brink but everything seems pointlessi amhaving trouble finding happiness in anything everything i do feels like its for the benefit of other people the only time i feel likei am doing something for me is when i play videogames and even then that feels unfulfilling at timesi eat healthy excercise dress well etc to impress girls not because i actually i enjoy excercising or vegetables or anythingi go through the motions and college and maintain a 30 gpa just to keep my parents off my back not becausei ampassionate about my majori dont really have the money to make any drastic changesi used to think finding love happiness but i amfeeling pretty deterred from putting in any effort into finding love since ive been shot down so many times before already on top of thati amfairly sure the world is ending or at least i dont see things improving any time soon,suicide

ive spent the last 6 years living a lie and i just want to end it all hey my name is beau and ive never posted on here before but i dont think i can keep all my pain i anymore i feel like i should start much earlier than 6 years ago so here i gowhen i was 3 years old i was diagnosed with a brain tumour i spent 2 years in and out of hospital i didnt even know what was happening all i knew was that my parents were letting these scary people in white jackets take me away and put me to sleep i would scream and scream at my parents while the doctors dragged me away i think this is where i first felt that i couldnt trust people and that i was completely alone i got better after that and went to a nice school it seemed like everything was fine i made some great friends i still know very well today and i seemed to be adjusting well even though i joined school late then i turned 8 and everything fell apart again i got another brain tumour and this time i was older and wiser and so was more fearful than the time before i knew what was happening and i didnt want to die i wont go on about it again but obviously i survived but it left me with some complication my pituitary gland had been damaged by chemotherapy and so i couldnt go through pubity unless i had the help of synthesized growth hormones which i had to inject into my stomach every night for about 8 years they worked pretty well though i would never have grown an inch and id still be the height i was at 10 years old but i am59 which is fine with me there was one problem though i felt that my head was quite a bit out of proportion with the rest of my body because the growth hormones i was given were only experimental i was bullied a lot at school for looking weird and it hurt my confidence quite a bit but i never spoke to anyone about it then i went to college and got to re invent myself and it was great for about a year that then you realise you cant really change what you look like and even though everyone liked me i still got bullied by a few people but the thing that really bothered me was that none of the girls i liked wanted to go out with me well i know that obviously not everyone is going to fall head over heels for you but it actually feels a lot worse than being bullied because the people who are rejected you arent bad people theyre good people they dont bully you for how you look but they understand the bullying and thus dont find you attractive for the same reasons the bullies bully younow lets get to the title ive spent the last 6 years living with a girl that ive been in love with for about 5 of those years weve had an incredibly strange relationship we were never going out we never had sex we never kissed its wasnt romantic for her but we did spend all day sometimes lying in bed hugging and kissing each other anywhere but the lips i was extremely confused because i told her i liked her but she said she didnt want to ruin our friendship weve spent almodt every day together for the last 6 yearsi am not a person anymore ive lost my identity fast forward to now shes decided she doesnt want to live with me anymore so she can go out with another guy one that she wants to be with hes taller stronger and hotter than me you can read the jealousy in my writing but she is my world and weve been together for so long that to me she was my other half nowi amalonei amhaving to move back to my parent and i actually just want to kill myself the saddest thing is she doesnt even seem to miss me which lowers my self esteem two fold i think the main reasoni amsad and she isnt is that i know that the time i spent with her even though she didnt love and never wanted to be intimate with me was still the best i could ever expect for myself i will be alone now for the rest of my life but she is beautiful and so will be fine she find the things i gave her and more from her new boyfriend i dont know what to do should i just kill myself if the best time of my life is over now i need some advice from people who wont sugar coat it,suicide

my confession at the beginning of my seventh semester already riddled with the feeling of guilt for having my parents spend much money on my education i took it upon myself to do whatever i can to recover it i refrained from going out with friends eating out and i never went on trips with them i started working online earned enough to sustain myself and save a little for the future an opportunity to save more arose when a internship opened up at a company upon consulting with my seniors i learnt it was no good a company to work for even so i joined for the monetary benefits that it provided i would be paid a stipend and also the dormitory fees for the final semester would be returned little did i know what i was signing up toon my first day of joining i immediately regretted my decision the place was far off and the people even more so i travelled in public transport many a time standing most of the journey which took more than an hour and a half each way with what little money i had left after all that was spent on travel i bought gifts for my family with all this travelling came the physical strain and a chronic back ache i put up with all this for more than five months hoping that if i could make it six months that would suffice and i would then work on getting abroad little did i know that the hard part was yet to comelittle did i know that my very own parents for whom i sacrificed so much would make me feel pain more than i even experienced before i always thought i could take pain i was right i could there are two types of pain the physical and the mental no one realises that the latter is much worse i have sacrificed so much for them and now when i need them the most they turn on me treat me like a criminal for i am not working not brining income not putting money on the table i have taken time out to write gre ielts gate and to learn german language i know there isnt enough time yet i am misunderstood and taunted and harassed for not working for not making money i have no place at what i used to call my home i am criticized for where i sit and for using my laptop and the wires that surround it i am criticized for the way i sleep a man needs two things in life to know he does not belong there the lack of a place to live and the lack of respect i have neither here i have contemplated ceasing to exist but decided against it for the people that know me and for my dreammy own mother who i have come to despise for her constant taunting and chiding and her narcissistic nature has no love for me her anger issues and irritable nature has changed me deepy and fundamentally i have come to realise they value money more than anything else for the past few months depression has been lurking above my head like a dark cloud and now i feel it has finally taken me over i feel numb devoid of all love and feeling i have come to a point where i am beginning to wonder why should i go on,suicide

i turned 24 a few days ago and i already feel like a failure i feel like i am too late and feel like i have no chance to survive in life i feel like giving up everyday edit i know that everyone else has difficulties and maybe this kind of hardship feels too close to home to some but please try not to just post this is so like me becuase it is not helping at alla few days ago i turned 24 but i was not excited to celebrate my birthday in fact i was horrified and even embarassedthis started to happen when i was around age 2223 but i was already feeling like i was too late in life like i was too late to have my shot to be able to have a good future in my lifei know that everyone goes through tough situations in their lives and everyone makes mistakes and have to go through obstaclesbasically shit happens to everyone a lot and most of them come unexpectedbut i felt like this ever since i was a teenager even though the world is very vast and has lots of things going on with lots of things happeneing at once it is very impatient and wants things to be done there are so many things going on and to catch up with everything is a nightmare and the world is changing incredibly and it is a lot of pressure on the competitive nature of the capitalistic world we live ini really wished that i had a grip in my life much earlier but i was a kid before i was an idiot with no clear goal and well shit happened bullies abuse and so much more and in the end it scarred me and it scarred me for so many years that only now i wanted to take charge and actually do something about it but every day i keep blaming myself for allowing these things to happen to me that i allowed myself to be such a weakling and make myself into a shadow of my own self and be a pussy instead of actualyl grabbing my own nuts like other people do and keep going and move onbut i was pushed back in a way and i felt stuck for many yearsi did manage to eventually try to push myself to keep going back on track but half of my attention is always concerning that i started to get a grip on my own life too late so i feel that i am mostly battling against my own guilt and shame and embarassed that i am too late and should already just give up everyday i keep making comparisons with everyone and often see everyone better than me better grades better income better lives better possible futures more happiness more confidence and so much more i feel like i am stuck in both my past and my future afraid of both sides and afraid and confused on what to do stuck because i feel like i have a lot of baggage about my past self and looking deep into myself to look into my own shattered soul is a fucking nightmare and a job that will take forever and incredibly painfulon the other hand i am afraid of the future i keep making countless and countless possible calculations and preparations for the worst like what if this guy is better than me should i study harder what if i will not pass this test should i apply for a job alreadyits extremely infuriating and scary especially when you own soul feels broken and your mind against you and criticizing your every move its trying to push yourself while trying to fix yourself at the same time while trying to battle against countless waves of enemies like the demons of the entire hell are after youhonestly i am 24 and i am still at university doing my bachelor degree there are those days where i feel very embarrassed that i havent graduated yet while people younger than me already did and i know that i have made many mistakes in my life and the shame and the guilt is very strong and very deep everyday but the worst part is that i have a poor habit of ruminating about those mistakes and unable to forgive myself or tackle it to make sure that i have the right strategy to tackle it if i ever happen to make that mistake again or avoid doing itmost of the time when i make a mistake i go into a dark spiral of shame and guilt and sheer selfcriticism and i end up in a cycle of criticism and doing those mistakes again and feel even worse in the processsometimes i even ruminate about my ruminating habit as well which makes the burden and guilt much worse and this habit has been happening for years and affected how i look at myself and affected how i work and how i think during my studies how can i break this habit what strategies i can use to help myself from going deeper into the cycle of depression anxiety and extreme selfhatred and selfloathing and suicidal thoughtshow can i really and truly stop being afraid of the future and stop criticising myself for pretty much anything because i feel like i am at the bottom of the food chain and i feel like i have no chance to survive in lifehonestly i often feel that i should just grab a gun and shoot myself and save all the trouble from trying to push myself when it will be all for nothing and avoid all the humiliation and embarassed many people have already managed to achieve a lot in life and i feel that i was left behind and i feel that maybe i should just give up i cannot risk experiencing further humiliation than i already have ,suicide

i just dont know what to do with myself anymore 24 m this is going to be long and complexi am sorry and thank you in advance to anyone who reads it ive been severely depressed and have had severe anxietyadhd my whole life but it started to get really bad when i was 17 i am 24 now i never struggled in school gradeswise but i did every other way i have one sibling an older brother who is severely disabled his health was getting worse while i was in high school through college during this time i was also coming out of the closet as queer because of these things i was getting no attention from my family and i instead turned to drugs and drug communities i called my friends for support i got arrested for possession twice but my dad just paid a lawyer to take care of it and nothing came of the arrests all records disappeared the whole process going through that was traumatizing though as people like the police and probation officers were incredibly shaming and abusive so the situation was taken care of but absolutely nothing was done for me to recover from the trauma to figure out how i got into drugs in the first place or what i needed to get better my dad just told me to keep workinggoing to school and act like nothing happened so i did my brothers health took a turn for the worst after i graduated college and basically my parents are providing him 247 care for everything pretty much just making him comfortable until he dies this started like two and a half years ago doctors say it is impossible that he is still alive but somehow he is and we have no idea how long hell survive i didnt have a job after graduating so i moved home to figure things out being in that environment where my parents were busting their ass and unable to get much medical support because of insurance red tape and usas shitty health care system in general to provide every single need to my brother even feeding him and helping him go to the bathroom i was just existing in the shadows being ignored i tried to help out as much as i could but it was just so painful it just sucked me deeper into a even darker depression i started smoking marijuana and drinking liquor from the moment i woke up to the moment i went to sleep every single day i lost all control i contemplated suicide very seriously and told my parents they decided to send me back down to the town i went to college in its close to where my dad travels for work once a week so he got an apartment and just had me live there he told me to go to the career center at my alma mater and try to find a job all of my friends from college either moved away stopped keeping in touch or just got into fucked up situations like one of my friends moved in with an abusive boyfriend so i was pretty much just trapped here alone family only cared about me being okay enough to work i turned back to the only thing i knew which was substance abuse i got connected back with the same drug communities and was in full swing of it againi am still doing it to this day even though i am severely depressed somehow i am still highly functioning and skilled i was able to find a job and i make good money now it is an incredibly stressful job though which just fuels the substance abuse even more which puts me at risk of getting caught again and losing everything i see a great psychiatrist but he is just as stumped as i am i think what i really need is to be removed from my normal adult life and be in an environment where i can make my mental health my 1 priority and not have to worry about anything else i feel like a monster being jealous of my brother because i wish my parents had the ability to take care of me until i get myself back on me feet but i have an apartment lease a car lease and this job i dont want i dont have the means of creating or finding that kind of environment i need i spend all of my freetime drinkingsmoking myself though bad emotional episodes because i am so stressed and in over my head i cant go home becausei amafraid i will become more depressed againi honestly just have no idea what to do with myself the only solution my doctor has is meds and therapy which ive been trying on and off for years without any real luck all i can really think about is offing myself i just want nothing more than to just give up on everything i know everyone at my age feels lost but i feel lost alone and unimportant like i could disappear and everyone would continue on with their lives i am to the point now where i am okay with just being a sad tragedy people share on their facebook pages and then move on with their lives,suicide
i think time is running out i think ive failed on getting out of the hole that i found out ive been digging myself into years so much of the advice ive heard wont help me i dont really have the will or want to push through the next day let alone yeari amat the worst point ive ever been if someone tells me i need to be strong i have the urge to curl up and tell them that it doesnti ama weak little person and it doesnt seem like making out is possible or even very rewarding,suicide
why try i ve always been a pretty gifted kid as far as most aspects go i excelled in most classes aside from math from an early age was pretty articulate even as a toddler and used to genuinely enjoy learning before all of the enjoyment was sucked out of it by the pressure on me my mom s always held me to a standard of a s and b s only even a c is failing in her book and now i m not meeting it i ve got too much work and i get it done but i want to relax too i don t want to be doing something educational 247 because i m too burnt out by the time i get home i m trying to bring my grades up but i just can t do it and now my mom s cold as ice to me and is taking away basically everything that gives me any sort of relief from the constant stress she knows i ve got depression and anxiety both actually diagnosed and she knows how she treats me isn t helping at all but she just doesn t care she says it s all because she wants me to succeed but if feeling like my own mother hates me and that i ll never be good enough and having constant mental breakdowns and suicide attempts because of my failed attempts to meet her standards is what it takes to succeed then i don t want to why even bother if i ll fail anyways why even bother trying to live a life that makes me wish i were dead the only thing that s really kept me here for almost 16 years is the thought of my friends and family but i don t care anymore my friends can move on and my mom s just going to have to deal with losing her only daughter because of her refusal to listen i try so hard to get help but there s no use in talking if nobody will listen nobody aside from god himself could convince her to give me a chance considering my dad s already tried and so have i so i m not even going to bother anymore i ve already got a method planned and a note so i m all set to go i don t need to be alive anymore not with a life like this i don t want to graduate i don t want to go to college i don t want a job or a family or anything like that if going through hell is what it takes to get that then i never will i can t be alive anymore because this life isn t worth living and i m practically already dead just not physically i ve been attempting suicide since i was a fourth grader believe it or not but this time i m going to make sure that it s not an attempt i may not be able to succeed at anything else but i can and will succeed in dyingi know this sounds like typical teen angst bullshit but i don t care anymore my whole life i ve always been told that things get better but they never have the only way to make things better is to die i m tired of being the broken gifted kid i m tired of being alive,suicide
i don t know what to do i want to die so badly but i m too scared to end it which just makes me feel angrier about everything it feels like everything i do is stupid and meaningless even if i work hard and find success financially it feels like it would all be for nothing since nothing in life makes me feel any happier there is this burning in my brain that just won t go away and i always feel like i m being choked all i want is to go to sleep and not wake up the next day but i doubt that ll be happening anytime sorry if this is formatted weirdly i m on mobile,suicide

please hear me out this is my first time on this subreddit but i think is time for me to seek help before going on please read everything i know its long but i really need someone to hear me outim currently a 20 yo male so i will start writing from the beginning it all started back when i was a kid i had an imaginary friend whose name was fred fred was always there for me and he was a great friend for pretty much all my life he bid farewell when i was 17 needless to say i cried all that daymy first episode with depression was back when i was 14 i think i got expelled from my previous school and entered a new one i had a lot of behavioural isssues back then so i felt abandoned and like i had betrayed the friends i had not only that i aso felt i disappointed my mother this was the second time i was expelledbut fred tried to cheer me up he did his best so i wouldnt be sulky all day long and i even met a guy he was the first persona i talked to in that school and was really happy for the first time i thought everything would get better from thenhowever the next day i went to school i didnt find that guy anywhere needless to say i felt devastated had i done something wrong did i scare him somehow all those doubts were bugging me back then some years later i found him again i met other people and made new friends while looking for him and asked him why he had disappeared he told me he didnt like our classmates so he changed his classroom he felt terrible when i told him how i felt to this day he still feels bad for what he did but ive got no grudges against himso i was all alone during my first year at that school with the exception of that single kid i didnt get along with anyone else so that year i was friendless i used to help my arts teacher do some works during the breaks so i wouldnt be alone all day long i learnt the hard way the value of human interaction otherwise i would be reading in the hall ive done this since i was a kidone day i was unbearably sad so i didnt feel like eating anything also you had to go to the dining hall so you could have lunch and i skipped lunch for a whole week cause i didnt want to go alone in there and be seen as a weirdo i was an idiot i knowso i stopped eating for that week got some nasty hunger pangs and ate as much as i could when i got home i also ate a lot during the weekends so my mom became suspicious one day i was feeling really really hungry since waking up so i ate my snacks it eased the hunger pangs for a while but during spanish class that teacher really liked me i passed outi obviously dont remember everything i was sitting in my desk and lost consciousness next thing i remember everyone was standing by my side looking at me someone went for stretcher and they carried me to the schools nurseryi stayed there for a long while and when i got out another teacher that really liked mei am still indebted to her if youre reading this thank you greeted me she began asking me questions beating around the bush until she told me so you say youve been eating well but i can prove otherwise she showed me a list they used which they checked when you entered the dinig hall i didnt have a single checkshe said she wouldnt tell my parents i begged her not to if i went to eat everyday i agreed and to this day my parents dont know about that incidentfast forwarding to college lifei decided to study medicine and entered college when i was 17 everything was fine i still was sad cause of freds departure he left when i was 17 remember but i was really happy for the change of environmentuntil one day i was having lunch at the dining hall and saw a guy who i thought was cute but said hey its fine you can find other people attractive doesnt mean youre gay i was wrong i had a crush on that guy i still kind of have to this dayi was really confused back then so i experimented with a different guy who liked me i didnt reciprocate though it was a terrible idea not only i felt bad for him i was struggling with my sexuality and that triggered another depressive episodelast year i finally came out to myself as bisexual i decided i needed to move on the guy i like has a boyfriend and has been with him for 2 years i think so i decided to talk to him i got really nervous and didnt tell him how i felt but i think it was pretty obvious from my body language to this day i still kind of have feelings for him i know its ridiculous we havent even talked except for that time but i am not jealous of his boyfriend i hope they stay in love and have a healthy relationshipif youre still reading this thank you i really appreciate itand now to the present dayive been having suicidal thoughts for some time actually i even have it planned i study medicine so i know thats a warning signi havent done it cause i promised fred not to do it and he told me that if i kill myself he wouldnt talk nor come see me again i know i should go to a psychiatrist but i dont want anyone in my family to know about thisthanks for reading this i know its long but i needed to write all the important details any help is really appreciated please be safe and have a nice daynight,suicide

theres only one reason i havent killed myself yet and its not a very good one cw rape when i was 17 i was raped he was my boyfriend at the time hed done something asked if it was ok if he slept with someone else on his upcoming 18th birthday or something like that and it had disgusted me i didnt want to have sex with him that night but no was not an answer he liked to hear previously when id said no he just got me drunk but that night he just kept pushing and pushing until i gave in because i felt like i had toi had a history of being abused before that my family was not a good one he knew this he had also systematically isolated me from all of my friends he knew there was nobody else in my life and he knew that gave him power i cried the whole way through and even though he didnt finish because it really started feeling like i was raping you and i am not a rapist that didnt erase the previous fifteen or so minutes if i remember correctly he didnt stop for me he stopped for his own selfimageto this day he is the only person i have had sex with willingly or otherwise and thats the only reason i havent killed myself yet i dont want to die knowing he was the only person ever to have fucked me it feels like hes winning especially since its been over half a decade since it happened and ive still not been able to be with someone elsei feel like thats slowly becoming less and less of a concern though nobody would want me now anyway i have no life in me theres nothing about me that would attract another person i recently realised after spending several months without any of my friends contacting me that i could literally have already been rotting and nobody would have noticedi dont know why ive not done it maybei amscared of the pain of failure,suicide

the harder i try the further i fall i was diagnosed with chronic depression pretty early on i think around 12 or 13 diagnosed with bipolar when i was 19 and bpd when i was about 24 and ptsd about a year ago i am now about to be 29 in a few weeks and i have been stuck in the worst depression of my life since this past december i had been in a depression before that but i d come out of it within days i can t come out of it this time its been almost 10 months i don t have the desire or will to live anymore no i do not want to kill myself nor do i have a plan but it s like my brain has become hardwired to just constantly obsess about suicide it s almost like i welcome the darkness lately i haven t even been able to get into a manic state in probably a year this is detrimental to me i could paint and make the art i love to make when i am manic my artwork was my outlet and i ve lost that spark i actually felt happy and content i actually live my life and get shit done with my depression comes the most god awful anxiety i ve ever experienced it s crippling and it affects my home relationships and work life i ve tried multiple medications and they only make things worse i actually got started on a new one today basically the reason i am writing this is because today i have been in the worst place mentally than i think i ve ever been i lost it today i had to move in with my family last december after my breakup i was suppose to be getting money saved and bills paid off my depression kept me from doing that well now as of four weeks ago today my checks began to get garnished by a hospital here in town for thousands of dollars well today i get a summons for court because that same hospital is suing me again for another bill that is thousands of dollars more than the garnishment happening right now and about a week ago i get a letter from the irs stating i m being put on a levy or pay 500 immediately and then find out my car has an issue that needs addressed immediately before the axel breaks and that could cost around 600800 i ve been struggling living paycheck to paycheck so i had no savings and i literally got paid today and have less than 20 to last s me another two weeks i m trying like hell but the harder i get pummeled the more i want to give up i know i am strong and i know i am capable of shit i can t even imagine but i m reaching my breaking point my body is small it can only take so much the constant self hate and self destructive behaviors destroy me it s like i won t allow myself to be happy i feel like that happy feeling doesn t exist inside me anymore why are we so frowned upon when we want to end our pain and suffering i get that people will be hurt by it and miss us but staying is torture i can t even enjoy being around family and friends because i m so lost in my head my anxiety causes me to panic and then everyone thinks that i am upset i ruin people s good vibes when i bring my bad vibes around so we are expected to stay and be miserable and horribly pained just so they won t feel the sting from us going elsewhere isn t it selfish on both ends i don t want to exist in this world but i don t want to die suicide haunts my mind and we are becoming a little too comfortable with each other i am strong but i am tired ,suicide
feel like i need to have it as an optioni am not sure where i should post this since it deals with multiple things but i will just post it here because it could be triggering and it is related to suicide i keep obsessing over the thought of friends committing suicide whenever they feel low or seem off i get anxious now i get anxious when they are physically unwell as well because i dont want to lose them and that is the first thing my mind goes to when i hear they arent feeling great physically but i noticed the kind of anxiety is very different i think i have now finally figured out that that is because i feel like if they commit suicide then i cant anymore since i will be seen as an attention seeker thus i feel like i dont have the option anymore and i will feel nervous sometimes it even makes me feel like i have to commit right now because otherwise i wont be able to do so anymore it drives me insane that i keep obsessing over these thoughtsother peoples wellbeing because i feel selfish and i also dont want them to feel upset and by thinking about this and being unable to stop doing so i can literally ruin anything for myself i also feel anxious because i dont want them to be upset even if i know they wont commit suicide i will just want them to be happy and i also just really dont want to lose them i think the obsessing part is very much ocd related and the keeping it as an option part is depression related but i have no clue how to solve this regardlessi am not sure what i want with this post just get it off my chest i guess ,suicide

ruined my life and his wishing to end it all i guess i will preface this with the fact that i am a 22 year old female i recently got alternatively certified to teach in tx without doing research on the school i accepted a job as a 4th grade teacher in a shit town in south texas called victoria the situation i was placed into was dismal at best everyone on the 4th grade team was new 2 of us first year teachers the other new to the district we were given very little guidance or instruction the job wore at me i couldnt sleep at night i woke up every hour with horrible anxiety 4 months previously i had met the man of my dreams he didnt have it all together but we fell in love fast and hard he had decided to take a job where hed be on the road traveling installing turf his job kept falling through little by little and he wanted to be with me in victoria one friday the overwhelming stress of the job got the best of me and i made the mistake of telling another teacher at the school that of i had a gun i would have already killed myself counselors and interventionist a stepped in and escorted me to a crisis center via cop car shortly there after my boyfriend decided to quit his turfing gig to come be with me thinking hed easily find work which wasnt the case he ended up doing day labor for 1012 an hour but depressed i still was i scored a job as a restaurant manager but through my depression i couldnt think clearly and the job seemed overwhelming and too much as well i ended up realizing i needed professional help and my parents are in a position to help so i called them and i left and went back to the dfw leaving my boyfriend in victoria tx almost broke with no job and no one to help him like i have he took a weed charge for me near san marcos and then got another ticket for driving with an invalid license so he has all this court stuff to go to in south tx and anyone he knows is in north tx i havent felt myself in a long time i feel incredible guilt and shame and resentment towards myself for my inability to keep it together i have suicidal thoughts daily ive lost 10 ppunds from not eating properly worst of all is just knowing that i have essentially ruined not only my own life but his life too when all he ever tried to do was help me and he believed me when i said that id be able to make it and that he should come down and be with me boy was i wrong the regret i feel for the struggle he will face is haunting he will most likely lose everything he has worked for his truck will be repossessed and none of this would have happened if it werent for me ,suicide

nothing left to doi amdone let me preface this by sharing that ive struggled with depression or some form of since i was a child at eight i started thinking about suicide not seriously as i was young but old enough to know that it could potentially be a viable option i wont get into the years leading up to this precise moment because thats a very long story but i will say they werent good id reckon its a 5050 of life being an asshole and me being an asshole either way i can count on two hands the happy memories i have of my 25 years being alive i didnt start taking my mental health seriously until a few years ago prior to that i smoked over ate over drank and basically sat on my ass all day with my now ex who wasnt great for me nor i him i couldnt even handle a part time job as the stress was too much i bounced around university programs until i settled on an easy useless degree to appease my familyi amjust trying to paint a picture here so the current picture is thisi ama mental health professionals wet dream i decided i couldnt use my experiences in life as an excuse to be a lazy slob and decided to do something about it from then on ive quit smoking drink minimally eat healthy enough exercise a few times a week have built friendships started new hobbies went into a healthyer relationship see a counsellor am on medication that seems to work quite well for the most part obviously and i practice loving and appreciating myself i have a great relationship with my parent who is letting me house sit so i can pay off my student loans without worrying about rent i have a full time job that is basically data entry and make less than i should for someone with a degree but enough for someone living rent free overall i have a really great life that isnt very stressful and has given me many opportunities i should be appreciative of so why the fuck do i want to kill myself why cant i just be content with my boyfriend my job my life why do i want to cry all the time why do i get upset angry and stressed so easily why do i hate my life i feel guilt about everything i even retroactively remember things that werent bad and turn it into something to ruminate on i am so sick of my constant state of guilt remorse sadness and anxiety i feel like ive done everything i can and i think maybe some people just arent cut out for life i live in constant pain and fear and sadnessi am too tired tired of this roller coaster i know i will be happy again i know there are things to look forward to in life but i also knowi am going to hit the bottom at some point i am so sick of clawing my way back up only to be pushed down i just feel done i dont want to get up anymore ,suicide

ive been passively planning my exit the last few years just need to do a brain dump now and get it out therei ama male in his 30s successful healthy people tell me they thinki am doing really well i think almost everyone would be surprised to hear i am thinking about suicide the last few years i have been planning my exit i dont know when exactly i will do it but probably before i turn 40my friends are all married and having children i am meanwhile trudging along trying to make new friends and stay involved in something outside of work i go to the gym a lot i read i have hobbies i travel i even moved across the country i can improve lots of things about my life i am a proud person and i am not helpless still i have no close friends that understand me and want to hear about what i am going through if i even hint at being depressed i get the old chin up tough guy or people just stop calling i also have very bad relationships with my family i have one sibling and we will probably never speak again not close with my parents i had one serious girlfriend but we broke up years ago and i have not tried a serious relationship since then lots of flings and short term dating but nothing serious and i dont think i could ever be in a relationship againi just cannot fathom a reason to keep living other than sheer momentum and the will to live i rarely experience any joy i just work either at my actual job or on hobbies and side projects i am constantly working the thing is i like working it gives me a purpose otherwise i feel like life is pointless i have to make something out of my life what else is there to do when you are my age dating is like torture to me everyone i meet on a dating site is just looking for someone to buy them dinner and drinks and show them a good time i feel objectified and i never feel a connection sex is meaningless sensory stimulation i enjoy it on a primal level but it leaves me feeling empty the only thing i can offer women is sex or the superficial stability that women in their 30s want basically to have a house and a car the trappings of a successful life but that isnt what i want i want to live a real life i want somebody who likes books and doesnt care about bullshit i have almost completely given up on women at this pointi am tired of getting burned and i dont want to date anyone i dont have a connection withmy sole hope in life is to somehow make that connection otherwise i think i am doomed to a life of working and striving for no reason for decades and decades until i am too old to work and i become useless i can keep plucking away at some of my goals for the rest of my life and maybe make some casual acquaintances friendly neighbors etc but am i so crazy to think this isnt good enough what is the point of becoming really smart and strong and talented and wealthy and amazing if there is no one else around and its just you in a room alonei dont want that to happen to me so i have started planning my exit i dont feel happy about this but it seems like the only way to have dignity in the rest of my life i dont want to be around for those decades alone it will be torture i am going to give myself another 56 years and make sure i have my ducks in a row so i can exit early if it seems like nothing is going to happenthe worst part is i cant tell anyone about this because i will be insulted and have them tell mei ambeing a selfish cunt or thati amjust being dark for even thinking about giving up my perfect life nobody understands i am completely alone in this world and it looks like i always will bethank you for letting me get that off my chest,suicide

less empathy for scary mental i willnesses ive noticed that the majority of sympathy towards those with mental i willness is almost always geared towards those with mild depression andor anxiety as opposed to those with chronic depression chronic suicidal thoughts treatmentresistant depression schizophrenia bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder whilei amby no means saying that depression and anxiety are laughing matters i am sick and tired of people with mild easilytreatable symptoms being treated as the standard as if they have any idea what the rest of us go throughtake selfharm for example if you have a few light cat scratches on your arm people will have much more empathy for you than the boy who breaks his bones or bangs his head on the wall or burns himself with cigarettes feel sad because you cant get a job have a little empathy hear voices see things that arent there always angry youre difficult youre a burden youre an emotional vampire youre an energetic drain youre a toxic person beyond helping feel a little bit anxious here have a bit of empathy cant leave the house because you feel like youre dying cant keep a job because social interactions makei am so sick and tired of people with situational depression who are magically cured almost fullyfunctioning members of society trying to tell people like me why we shouldnt die no one wants to be around someone who wants to kill themselves everyday no one likes it when youre clingy and have mood swings and have to be babysat everyday to make sure you dont off yourself i struggle from an eating disorder i make cuts in my skini amalways suicidal amglad you went to a mental hospital and realized that all your problems could be fixed by mine arent my problems rule my life and theyre something i will struggle with forever they color every part of my life there are much less resources for people like me and i will never be apart of the conversation on mental i willness because everyone would feel better if people like me didnt exist to begin withim a burden on everyone around me,suicide
what is mental health i dont mean that literally but it kind of plays into how i feel i feel like my mental health has completely deteriorated i think i suffered from clinical depression anxiety low selfesteem loneliness and avoidant personality since age 11 and until after high school i feel like this has left me horribly developmentally stunted i feel like my entire life has been one large distraction from life itself having spent nearly all of my free time playing videogames and watching television that did absolutely nothing to improve who i was in any way i think i only ever swam in my youth swam usa club teams for 7 years was because the endorphin release it provided was merely another means to escape feelings of anger boredom loneliness depression and inferiority i kept sacrificing so much of my time towards it because of the escape the only reason i gave a shit about my times or stoke technique was because it helped me feel superior to other people but dont mistake me here i didnt flaunt my in the grand scheme of things unimpressive swimming abilities in peoples faces i just quietly basked in the glory that came from being better at something than most people despite also not being very good in the world of people who took swimming seriously i never had any solid interests in anything important growing up i still dont really but being an adult forces you to semicare about the important things things that i not once ever seriously considered like who i am what my role in society is whati amgood at where i need to improve what the road to succeess looks like what path i should take in my life etc i always coasted along on this strange unjustifiable feeling that i was great and deserved great things in an almost narcissistic way i lived constantly in fantasy and daydreams of accomplishing whatever i wanted to at the time but never actually did anything to get there because from an incredibly young age probably starting in elementary school i always felt inferior and i never resolved these issues because i never felt comfortable talking to anyone like my parents about these internal struggles from the day i was born i never vocalized my feelings of inferiority which i think is partly because of shame but also not thinking anything of if why idk i blame it on myself for being a dumb kid who never learned how to communicate these things and still dont to this day because it would be plain inappropriate to share these things with a fellow adult who isnt a shrink that i cant afford i could talk to my parents but i have and let me assure they are far far from able to provide me any solace my mom is 52 and faces issues that fall in line with early dementia and has too many complicated emotional issues of her own to ever be able to help me my father is 61 suffered a stroke deeply effecting his ability to properly socialize and also suffers from depression and low selfesteem he actually went to the hospital for suicidal ideation this summer anywaysi am so tired i cany fucking finish this post and say all i wanna say but fuck i want to jump off the harry nice bridge so fucking bad the only word i can use to accurately describe myself is broken and as you can see that just barely scratches the surface id like to go into how becoming more aware of this brokenness in highschool lead to a weed habit that sabotaged pretty much every shot at success i had to this very day and how that just provided a nicer escape with the added bonus of but a semblance of a social life that i was and still am so desperate to have the ultimate escape just seems too appealing at this point ,suicide

dunno what to do but someone is afraid of me and id rather be dead than be someones bogeyman she and i were good friends for a while then i fell in love then a week later she said no thanks very much and cut off contact i knew shed been going through a really hard time and the more friends the merrier so i did my best to fall out of love again but it was cripplingly difficult id never had any of those feelings before when i succeeded eventually i tried to reach out and say that i hoped we could agree to forgive and forget and that if she ever needs someone to talk to then i remain a friend for my part but i made some dumb but understandable mistakes along the way and she now believesi ama dangerous psychopathic stalker i wanted to try and help alleviate some of her troubles and nowi ama cause of them shes afraid of me i dont want her to be id rather be dead and i certainly believe i dont deserve to live after this if she knew i was dead she wouldnt be afraid of me and you dont feel guilty for the death of a monster but at the same time i have friends and family who dont think i did anything immoral and although i dont contribute much to them or to society id be letting them down i dont know what to do i just know that if i knew it would make things better for her i would choose to die its been months since i was in love with her but i love her very much if that makes any sense thats something that will never be understood or believed because sticking someone in the monster box and keeping them there is easier than actually forgiving them what would you do if someone you cared about was terrified of you how could you know that and justify being alive,suicide

apparentlyi amhatednot welcome anywhere in a matter of 3 months i got kicked out from every forum and abandoned by every friendup to yesterday i was staff in a website today i get kicked out and framed since i was pissed i deleted some of the files on the ftp but they changed the ip and restored everything i realized i would have done much more destruction through the admin control panel via ftp but i didnt realize that until after i got kicked out from other forums for not taking shit from the staff for example in one of them i created something and one of the staff decided to steal it and declare it as his own that caused me to leak the source code for everyone to use and both me and the mod lost sales i felt better that he couldnt monetize from that any longer this led to me being blacklisted from every event the whole staff team would do or actual staff applications another forum incident was i was selling another one of my programs of course no license sincei amlazy to add that in this guy buys it and shares the license with his friend once something went wrong with the program he his friend and about 30 more decided to mock me and bring my reputation down then he demanded i help him and his friends and i refused due to him breaking my purchase policies the staff sided with this guy and got me banned for not refundingfixing his programfor the friend part i stopped coding and spent most of my time playing games with them 34 in short i realized that only one really wanted me there and the other 3 preferred to play without me i like being kind of a leader saying what to do what not to do and what i should do instead of them such as lets drop there pubg or let me be that character since you dont really know how to use it rainbow six siege all my online friends found other friends to talk to play with code with my best friend found a job and is working 8 hours a day and going everywhere without me with minimum contact with me the only times he invites me out i actually cant meet him due to me being with my girlfriend being the weekends basicly now i have nowhere to go or anything to do rather than code but what is the point of coding if i cant sell my creations anywhere in their specific famous forums i go to gym every morning and sleep at 5 am the only person who ignores my leadership characteristic is my girlfriend and she puts up with all my crap she basicly is the only person that makes me feel happy and wanted i dont know why on the contrary everyone else hates me and wants me to be gone being hated by everyone means i cant sell my creations or have anything to talk about with anyone on the forums part i cant let anyone take advantage of me and step on me and control what i do what is wrong with me in your opinion i really want to get better and be liked by the majority rather than hated by the majority,suicide

anxietyfuelled suicidal thoughts ive struggled with anxiety for much of my life and it has brought me to the edge of suicide on a few occasions i never made any actual attempts i just had very clear plans that i backed out of at the last or nearly last moment when i was 16 i thought i wouldnt live to see 20 at 20 i thought id be dead by 25 at 25 the age moved back to 30 now at 29 i dont expect to kill myself imminently but i believe it will be how i die finally after 29 years i realized that my anxiety brings me here the fear and worry just grips my mind and wont let go either i fear so much about what is happening or i worry so much about what will happen i start to feel as if suicide is the only way to save me from myself two weeks ago i almost made this post i was in a dark place i held off later i recovered that lasted about four days nowi amback right where i left off afraid worrying wanting to escape the last time i had a plan i planned to jump of a bridge nearby where i live a bridge that many people have successfully used to kill themselves in the past last time i also tried to put my affairs in order before i killed myself now my plan is still valid and my affairs are still in order i dont think i will kill myself tonight i feel i will kill myself soon i have often felt that way though the frequency with which i feel like killing myself makes me not want to seek help for it why worry others when i know i wont do it but i feel like i will do it maybe not tonight but sooni am not sure where this post is heading it would be helpful for me to hear how others deal with suicidal thoughts driven by their own anxiety again i dont want to die like many here i just dont want to live like this ,suicide

requesting all counselors this isnt even a throwaway account but i have all the typical suicidal thoughts etc one thing that frequently triggers them are jobs getting the same old well you arent going to like everyone you work with or work is work its part of the real world all that bullshit i hate it i dont want to put any effort in to living a pointless life but i have a skill in wording convincing chicks for nudes hmu i thought about it and counselors get some decent pay not trying to be a dick but counselling isnt that hard i find giving advice easy and i find talking one on one about a sensitive topic to be easy also i reckon after a little bit of learning the right wording techniques id be pretty damn good at it should i pursue it i have had my fair share of anxiety suicidal thoughts etc perhaps a job as a counselor is a possibility,suicide

destiny i started college one week after my 16th birthday i got a huge academic scholarship to go to a nice private university and everyone was so proud of me i got used to everyone boosting my ego and calling me a genius everything started going downhill when i started dabbling in the drugs drinking and partying i was such a smart kid but the pressure to keep being the person when i started struggling a lot in school because i wanted to be friends with all the wrong people through my newfound freedom in college i never really found that balance in college between friends and academics it was either one or the other when i was 18 i racked up thousands in credit card debit that i can never escape but it was okay because i kept up that facade of a care free lifestyle growing up dirt poor and abused for all of my life until i left for college this was the life i thought i deserved for all of my handwork wrong i shouldve kept trying harder but my parents never taught me how to be a good person i cant blame them entirely though because i know now what is right and what is wrong but i choose the wrong path every time at 19 i didnt do so well on my grad school entrance exam so i had to retake and take a year off well this wasnt really an option for me because i would always take massive student loans out to be able to live in nice apartments and not have to actually have a job i didnt think i could get a job with my major either this was where things really fell apart my parents pressured me into staying in school for another year and take out those loans because they made me believe i wouldnt last in the real world without financial aid turns out they were stealing money from me for 4 years through my financial aid account and were trying to keep the cash flow going during this year i was so ashamed to tell my friends that i hadnt gotten a degree so i lied i lied to everyone all the time that i got my degree then the lies got bigger because that wasnt enough to appear normal i became a babysitter while taking online classes didnt want to run into anyone on campus but i lied all over social media and in person that i had this kickass lifestyle and job i feel horrible that i did all of that but i just wanted to be fit in like all of my young professional friends i couldnt because i had the maturity of a 20 year oldat 20 things started looking up i got into grad school with a great scholarship i was so happy my parents were finally proud of me again everything felt great again because i had buckled down and tried so hard to get into the 75th percentile of my entrance exam then things started getting bad again during the summer i was taking 3 classes that i needed to pass in order to get my degree and start grad school finally i couldve graduated a year ago but i kept going to school for financial aid this was the worst decision of my life i had signed my lease already in a different city had a roommate borrowed 3000 for various expenses thought i was going to be reimbursed with my scholarship and i event went to orientation i dont know what happened i dont know what i did to become so stupid but i failed one of the required classes by 02 i needed a 60 to pass and i got a 598 i pleaded with the professor and then appealed to the dean i got a cold callous response how could i miss the final exam because i thought it was optional i had read the syllabus over and over i had sat in class why couldnt i focus and comprehend what happened to me why did the words get jumbled up when i read them and i couldnt understand this has never happened to me before the professor and the dean thought i was incompetent which i am i explained everything to them about my situation and what failing the class would mean my professor told me your destiny is in your hands not mine i fucked up my destiny i couldnt tell anyone about this not even the people closest to me in my life because i had already spun everyone this web of lies luckily the grad school let me defer for a year because during the year that i spent leaching off of financial aid and after i got into grad school i started failing my classes because i didnt think they mattered my gpa dropped by 45 i couldnt get into the school again if i had to reapply stupid right i made stupid decisions and i became stupidwhere am i today well its supposed to be my first month of grad school in a new city surrounded by passion for the field i love and intelligent wonderful people but instead i am sharing a one bedroom apartment with my older brother who supports me in every aspect of life i love and appreciate him so much because hes the one person i can be honest with because i know hell love me anyways i cant get a good job because i dont have a degree i dont really know whati am going to be doing for this next year but i barely ever leave the apartment or do anything thats not watching tv and getting highi amlostmy breaking point of how much everything sucks is that this man harassed and berated me in the parking garage for almost hitting him while on my way up he followed me all the way up to my assigned parking spot waited for me to get out of the car with my groceries and started screaming at me when i did i calmly apologized but he wouldnt stop i have been so hurt since that happened last week because i already have horrible selfesteem and negative interactions like that just destroy me he just wouldnt leave me alone and i didnt understand why my kindness didnt fix things yesterday i got a package and attempted to pick it up from the leasing office they said i couldnt because it had my brothers name on it weird because i know it was mine my brother came down this morning and they said i couldnt get any mail delivered here because my name wasnt on the lease and further went on to say that i almost hit someone in the parking garage so they lied to me yesterday i cant even stand up for myself my name cant be on the lease because my parents fucked up my renters history and i have terrible credit i feel trapped in a one bedroom box another reason not to leave my house anymore i cant do anything right i cant even live like a hermit righti dont know howi am going to finish this year off i just feel so broken i used to be this beautiful successful witty and full of life girl but underneath all of that is just the person i am today a leech a liar a worthless filler of space i thought i could change my life and make some difference but i cant escape my destiny i try to be nice to people and i get walked all over all my friends are moving on and here i am digging myself into a deeper hole,suicide
concerned for a friend wont add too many details as they browse reddit heavily a friend has always been the type to joke and troll a lot but lately she has seemed very depressed staying home most of the time seeing no point to normal living this person wants the whole world to be at their beck and call and anything less isnt worth living it sounds clinically delusional to me like severely warped expectations at the same time we hang out and have a good time from time to time and all seems well but the way they casually talk about killing themselves not in a joking way in a very serious way obviously has me concerned i have been reaching out and i am trying to be a very positive voice in her life and it seems like things are marginally improving over time i would be worried that reporting my friend to a suicide watch or pushing them into therapy might alienate them from one of their only friends and positive influences me so far i feel good about the progress made but it would be devastating if they went through with a suicide and i didnt do everything possible to prevent it would welcome any advice ,suicide
lonely depressed and suicidal hello everyonerecently ive been in a state where for the past couple of weeks now ive been at a loss of any kind of interaction with my friends for further context i found that even with new friends that ive made through school hospitalization etc just dont care about me and i feel as if they pass me off as if i dont exist before pushing them away because of this in these past couple of weeks i would always genuinely wonder how they were doing so id ask with little to no responses i just know it goes a long way with me when someone takes time to ask me howi am doing so id try to communicate with my friends as much as possible because i love and care about them but would they say the same back the thing is in these past few months any friend that ive had has left me for something or someone better over different situations and those that still try and put minimal effort into being relevant in my life rarely ever call or text to say hi or ask howi am doing it hurts you knowi am not trying to come off as egotistical but ive always cared for people in my life and i always look to let them know i care just by being there for them whenever and i guess maybei aminvisible to them or not important on their own paths in life based on how they treat me back its always been me texting or calling first despite the immense amounts of anxiety that it gives mei am sorry i know it doesnt sound like much of a problem but i havent always had friends just recently in high school sophomore year junior now was when things started to pick up for me in my social life things were going great for awhile actually and now like i shouldve anticipated everything seems to be against me people i used to talk to dont bother with me anymore i cant show my face in school because of rumors spread last school year and even those friends that stuck after those rumors settled the ones that i knew wouldnt buy the bullshit have just seemed to vanish i guess they werent saying anything to me for days so i just turned my phone off because i was hurting enough already from other things i wont talk about in this i turned it on to post this however and there was still nothing i dont know what i did to those close friends i still had i barely know why rumors were started about me other than that i heard my ex spread them to see me suffer again when i and they knew that i was moving on and doing better in short i dont know whyi ambeing treated like this high school is a nasty place being a teenager is even worse my depression and anxiety have seemed to skyrocket from years ago and only keep affecting me more and more everyday and i just dont know how much more of it i can take ive already been hospitalized because of a suicide attempt several months ago over being trapped in my own thought and because of those rumors that ultimately led to a bad rep harassment and bullying to notei am still harassed by people connected with my ex which i also guess goes as cyberbullying as well another reason why i keep my phone off i just wish those people knew the truth i wish they couldve heard me crying for days and nights on end because of how one false rumor led to a lot truly a lot that i my family friends that stuck with me and god even my ex probably subtly knew i didnt deserve anyway being in that mental hospital for a week put a lot of strain on my family and honestly being lonely like this everyday sure as hell doesnt benefit them as it only makes my depression so much worse to be isolated like this my point is the thoughts of thinking that life is meaningless are returning because my experiences in life have only proven that this happens time and time again never has a single person in my life just seemed to have cared like legitimately as in sure ive had nurses that have taken care of me therapists that listen to me and other forms of support but theres one thing in common with them all and its that they likely know theyre being paid to care about me saying that sounds fucked but i do know theyre goodhearted people its just paying people to hear me out doesnt seem too right in my mind i think its more right that we should be able to share our emotions our problems and just pay ourselves in the way of knowing that we simply helped someone id say the only person that cares deep down is my mom but ive stopped telling her about my problems because i feel as if itd be easier for her if i stopped and just died after all the emotional stress ive especially put on her and the rest of my familyi am in the process of writing and rewriting notes for when i decide to leave its only a matter of time before something new pushes me over the edge or when that thought telling me that life will always be like this wins and itd truly be for good this time i promise myself that maybe i should set a date and if things arent better by then yeahim sorry if this was long i needed a place to put my mind onto paper where people would see it and hopefully understand me for once in a long long time ive never sent or posted anything this long so i may regret and delete it but the thought will still remain from the paragraph before this one back to binging netflix i should also note that my mom thinksi amslowly becoming anorexic based on how little she thinks i eat everyday and the weight loss shes noticed i dont know if this is the right place to post about that but regardless ive come to realize after a bit she may be right we all struggle with something so from my heart i hope the best and most peaceful moments for everyone here feel free to reply id really appreciate it goodnight ,suicide

i feel like i cant breathe i was hospitalized twice over the past two months for my mental health issues i thought i was improving but these past few weeks have been shit and tonight ive just been spontaneously crying and having frequent panic attacks i dont want to end it but at the same time i feel i must for being the sort of person i am a worthless ugly female of all things with no talents of any kind and nothing inherently decent to offeri dont know how much more of this i can take i want to scream or just lie down forever,suicide
am still alive my lack of knowledge where the heart is made me miss the fatal blow by few inches away why didnt they just let me diei amsick and tired of people saying i got my life ahead of me and i am still young and i shouldnt kill myself and i amjust overeacting to a heart break well this heart break had just killed me in the inside whats wrong to be completely dead ive got nothing left inside me now love is a very funny because the thing is no matter how hard i tell her that she meant alot to me how much i tell her i love her how i would sacrifice everything just to be with her and yet she just look away from it like my feelings doesnt mean anything to her its so hard to confess that you love someone that you adore everything about them but its so easy to say no to shot you down just because you missed out certain thing that they want the feeling of dying seems alot comforting than to live one of more second of my pathetic life ,suicide
am not me anymore sorry if this is all over the placebeen depressed for as long as i can remember always try to smile on the outside but insidei amdead anxiety social anxiety depression and i thinki ambipolar 21 and havent got a job yet nobody to stand by me nobody to tell me its ok not like id believe them anyways were basically homeless right now so i cant just leave my mom and sister like that once we get our place though i think itll be my time been cutting my wrists to see if it would hurt it didnt carved fuck into my leg didnt feel a thing weed is my fucking lifeline right now but whenever i run out in comes the depressed state where i just want to sleep all day wish i would just get shot or stabbed already i no longer fear the razor though so thats probably gonna be my way out dont know exactly when or where but i know its gonna happen cant think straight anymore fuck life ,suicide
