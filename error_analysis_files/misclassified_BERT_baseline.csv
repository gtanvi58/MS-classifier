"The United States is in turmoil, more so that at any other time in history. States hate other states, the electoral college is under attack at every turn and the races are at each others throats. On top of this is a two party political system, split by racial, social, cultural, linguistic and class divides. The end result is a nation in gridlock, unable to respond to any great change, unable to commit to any great projects. A political and social stalemate that makes any advancement impossible. Meanwhile the 10000 ton boulder of demographic change rolls ever forward, gaining momentum and possibly destroying all in its path. Eventually, when the white population of the USA realizes the truth of the situation, war will erupt.",1,0,

"To compete, people have to get better credentials by spending more time in college. It used to be that a high school degree was worth something. Now a bachelorï¿½s degree is whatï¿½s recommended to be competitive in the job market. The cost of college degrees has exploded as their value has plummeted. This has led to a generation of indebted, overqualified students filling menial, low paying and unfulfilling jobs. Of course these migrants and their children have contributed to the problem, but are not the sole cause of it. The American lifestyle affords our citizens an incredible quality of life. However, our lifestyle is destroying the environment of our country. The decimation of the environment is creating a massive burden for future generations.",0,1,

"I was in Washington, D.C., a week ago Thursday, when they were debating whether or not they should let the bill come onto the floor. And in the back of the room where the Senate meets, there's a huge map of the United States, and on that map it shows the location of Negroes throughout the country. And it shows that the Southern section of the country, the states that are most heavily concentrated with Negroes, are the ones that have senators and congressmen standing up filibustering and doing all other kinds of trickery to keep the Negro from being able to vote. This is pitiful. But it's not pitiful for us any longer; it's actually pitiful for the white man, because soon now, as the Negro awakens a little more and sees the vise that he's in, sees the bag that he's in, sees the real game that he's in, then the Negro's going to develop a new tactic.",1,0,

Just be careful about what you write. Select ""Private Entry"" for anything that might be perceived as suspicious. For now. ",1,0,
"I know that I will be accused of desiring sexual contact with children, and there might possibly be accusations that I have already had it, but neither case is true. I also have not seen any degree of child pornography nor intentionally seen any adult pornography. All of the sexuality which is rampant in this society in general is as disgusting to me as pedophilia is, but that isnï¿½t sufficient reason for me to desire the violent persecution of anyone over it because of personal perspective. Iï¿½m pretty confused when it comes to my sexuality, but Iï¿½m certain that Iï¿½m not a pedophile.",1,0,

"Before any one of you claims that I am Harrisï¿½ or anybody elseï¿½s copycat, you should think about it for a moment: Is a priest in a small village only the popeï¿½s ï¿½copycatï¿½? No! Of course not! He believes in the same thing as the pope, but he doesnï¿½t copy him. He looks at things the same. Like the fucking pope, he is part of a whole.
