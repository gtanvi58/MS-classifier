"He walks alone :   He opened the door, walked down the hallway, down the stairs, and continued out the front door. Destiny was at hand.",1,0
"No more! We demand that car drivers pay their own way, bearing the full cost of the automobile-petroleum-industrial complex that has depleted our environment, strangled our cities, and drawn our nation into foreign wars. Reinstate the progressive motor vehicle excise tax, hike the gas tax, and toll every freeway, bridge, and neighborhood street until the true cost of driving lies as heavy and noxious as our smog-laden air. Our present system of hidden subsidies is the opiate of the car-driving masses; only when it is totally withdrawn will our road-building addiction finally be broken.",0,1
"Canvas public areas in support of radical positions, even if they are not your own. Incite conflict.Place posters near public parks calling for sharia law, then in the next week place posters over such posters calling for the expulsion of all immigrants, repeat in every area of public life until the crisis arises. Destabilize, then take control. If we want to radically and fundamentally change society, then we need to radicalize society as much as possible.",1,0
"Basically, I take the belief that everyone should have equal rights and apply it consistently. Iï¿½ve had these thoughts for years and havenï¿½t spoken to anyone about them. Iï¿½d like to be able to discuss this in a topic, but it will probably be too offensive. Iï¿½m going to keep it to myself for now. And now that I think about it, this might sound a bit satirical, but itï¿½s not.",1,0
"I chase an ideal, I choose to chase passion. The shortest lasting happiness that is based off stimuli and always chasing the next high.  It is this happiness that most people focus on with things like material possessions or sex, yet it has been proven to be a very fleeting form of happiness.",0,1
"It seems like an irrelevant question to be concerned about. No one can obtain knowledge about what happens after death, nor if anything is required to do for the deceased. If some ritual was necessary, no one could know about it nor have any knowledge about the requirements of it. Perhaps there's a magical platypus who requires that you burn a wooden effigy of a hamster so that the deceased can ride it to the gates of Valhalla. From observing other people who have died, the only conclusion which can be reached is that nothing happens.",1,0
"Greed has poisoned menï¿½s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lostï¿½.",0,1
" A NEET or neet is a young person who is ""Not in Education, Employment, or Training"".

 A week goes by in a day now.",1,0
"Death is certain, you may die in service to some grand crusade or pass away in a hospice, either way you will die. What matters is your actions during the brief time between birth and death. The worth of your life is not measured by the length of your life, but your actions during it",1,0
"Yet when we learn about anything important done by a black person in history, it is always pointed out repeatedly that they were black. For example when we learn about how George Washington carver was the first nigger smart enough to open a peanut. On another subject I want to say this. Many White people feel as though they don't have a unique culture. The reason for this is that White culture is world culture. I don't mean that our culture is made up of other cultures, I mean that our culture has been adopted by everyone in the world. This makes us feel as though our culture isn't special or unique. Say for example that every business man in the world wore a  kimono, that every skyscraper was in the shape of a pagoda, that every door was a sliding one, and that everyone ate every meal with chopsticks. This would probably make a Japanese man feel as though he had no unique traditional culture.",1,0
"I can still see Frankie, drinking tinnies in the Grand Hotel on a thirty-six hour rec.leave in Vung Tau. And I can still hear Frankie lying screaming in the jungle. ï¿½Till the morphine came and killed the bloody row. And the Anzac legends didnï¿½t mention mud and blood and tears, and stories that my father told me never seemed quite real. I caught some pieces in my back that I didnï¿½t even feelï¿½ God help me, I was only nineteen.",0,1
"The only animals that suffer from anxiety are the ones that associate with humans. I donï¿½t trust people who are very articulate. The only way to be sane is to embrace your insanity. When you feel guilty about being sad, remember Walt Disney was a manic depressive. Everything I said, could be totally wrong.",0,1
"Once the corporate and state medias grip on the zeitgeist of modernity was finally broken by the internet,true freedom of thought and discussion flourished and the overton window was not just shifted, but shattered. All possibility of expression and belief was open to be taught, discussed and spoken. This open and often anonymous discussion allowed for information, outside of the states and the corporation control, to be accessed often for the first time. The result is obvious.",1,0
